these misguided poets left the usual places ol recitation to accept from
a shabby patron a dirty raom and a packed audiente. ·

38. Ipsefiacr't wear] This scurvy patron himself affects tabe ergoet
inferior to omer only t'or the 'reverence due to his antiquity ; an , to

show that he has apoet's sympathies, he lends his poor brother a dirty ’

roam, which had long been locked up as festas tho gates of a town
when the enemy is coming. lle also gives him a lew of his depend-
ents to sit at the end of the room and in different parts to applnud
him ; but he leaves him to go to the expense of hiring his own bertches

see A. 59, t, a; Μ. 37ος A. da S. 261, R. 2. The sarno construction

like a theatre, with ‘ subsellia‚' which are benches placed about the
roorn on the floor; ‘anabathra' or benches rising one above the other
at the sides of the room ; and an orchestra, reserved scats near the
speaker. The orchestra in a Greek theatra was the circular space in
front of tho stage occupied by the chorus. In Romen theatres, which

nearly resembled the Greek, the orchestra was given up to the accom— ,

modation of senators and magistrates and other persons of distinction.

Here the reciter put chairs for his more important auditore. ‘Con- ζ

ducto anabathra tigillo' is equivalent to ‘conducta anabathra tigil-
' lsghss hired seats ol' plnnk. ‘Posito sst,' the orchestra is set out with

commonplace; ‘expositum' means such as you would meet with in
the highway, and so is ‘triviale' ln ‘vena' the metaphor is taken
from mines. ‘Deducere’ is commonly applied to verse-making, and
is probably taken from spinning. The works oi the brain are corn·
rnorrly in most languages described as the coinage of a mint3 and
Juvenal speaks of tho man whose ideas are not coined at the common
mint, in which all manner of base metal is struck, and then passes cur·
rent among the ignorant. The temple ol duno Moneta (from moneo,
corresponding to Μνηιιοσὺνη) was the Roman mint. Both ‘money’
and ‘mint' oro derived from the word.
