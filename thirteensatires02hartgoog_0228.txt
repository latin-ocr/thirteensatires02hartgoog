could be inflicted on the man ior his meanness: a long, dreary life

SATIRE XIII.

A raiano ol Juvenal’s, whom he calls Calvinus, is in a state oi great ’
excitement about a fraud practised upon him by one to whom he had
given in trust a sum oi money, and who had denied the trust on oath.
Juvenal writes to him ridiculiug his wrath as mean and unphilosophi-
cal. The satire takes tbe ionn ol expostulation and ironical consolation
throughout. Itis most l'amiliarly known as dealing with the subject oi
an accusing conscience, which it does in averypoweriul way. But this
is only one part of the whole. The character oi the times and the con-
trast ol the past and tbe present oecupy much oi the poem, and there is
avery fine passage describing the way in which men tamper with guilt
and argue themselves into the commission oi it, and put on a bold face as
ot innocence. There is no need of the supposition that ‚Juvenal derived
the ideas oi this satire from the doctrines oi Clnistianity. There never
was a time when conscience did not exist in the mind oi man, however
completely the habit oi guilt may have seared it in some and have

given a color oi innocense to wickedness in the judgment oi whole ·

communities. Whatduvenal says on the subject oi conscience derives
its only weight from its truth; and though he exaggeratas when he
leads to the inierence that the stings oi a guilty conscience must nec-
essarily follow guilt, the picture he draws is taken from experience,
not from revelation, the experience ot those who were no Chris·
tians and had no knowledge to friglrten thern but that which was
suggested from within. The soliloquy in which a man argues away
the misgivings with which he enters upon crime or the denisi
oi it, represents no doubt the conduct and feelings oi many who
have more light than that of conscience; but there too the man
is nota bad Christian, but a bad pagan3 and it we are surprised
to read in Juvenal language or sentimenta which il delivered irom a
Christian pulpit would be appropriate and searching, it is because wo
are apt to iorget that human nature, with its desires, its corruptions,
and its selideceptiona has always been the same in the main, and that
God has never been without his witness against guiltin the heart of man.
The reader had better take up this satire as representing the common
moral sense of mankind, and look to the law oi Christianity as confirm-
ing the unwritten law of which conscience has always 'been the guar-
dian and the exponent, and oi which such writings as J uvenal’s, espe-
cially tbis poem, are the clearest evidence. From v. 17 it is commonly

interred that the poem was writteg4in Hadrian’s reign, about sp. 119.
