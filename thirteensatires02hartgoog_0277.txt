21. cffin'nnt curabile nt ait] ‘curabilis' is not found elsewhere. It

means that which wauts curiug. The way of speaking, ‘gravior cura·
bilis,' is Greek; the usual Latin would be ‘gravius' The lengthening
of the short vowel before the two consonante (22) is not uncommon.

22 Dignum erit crgo] “Itis a proceeding then worthyof the ranir
ing Vagellius with bis stupid hardihood, as long as you have two
sound legs, to provoke so many shoes, such thousands of hohnails.'
{pis is explained above ou verse 14. Wbo Vagellius was is not

own.

25. Quis tam procul obsit] “ Besides this (he asks) who would come
so far from town, who is so fast a friend (such a Pylades) that he will
come out to the camp to give evidence for youl We had better dry
up our tears forthwith, and not pingue our friends who are sureto
make excuses, when the judge tells us we must bring·witnesses.''
‘Molem aggeris’ is referred to in x. 95, “castra domestica,'' and
mentioned in v. 153, “ in aggere rodit,’' and note. The praetorian camp
is here referred to. ‘Tam procul' therefore is ironical, for the camp
was not above a quarter of a mile from either of the two gates Collina
and Esquilina, north-east of the city. A man must bea Pylades to
take suche walk for a friend, though the Agger which overlooked the
cpfimp wpp pcoprplon proipenpde. The judex here is the military

³³. Contra paganum pulsis] ‘Paganus’ after the time of Augustus
came to be applied to all civilians as opposed to military men. It may
have been first given them by soldiers in the way of contempt, for it
belongs properly to the country people. ‘Pudorem' is his honor,
' which the soldier is supposed to prize more than the man of peace.
The word is so used in viii. 83.

36. Sacrantentorum.] ‘Sacramentum' was the soldier’s oath which
he swore by the ‘signa' (standards), promising fidelity to his country
and his commender. The oath was administered on cnlistment. It
is used here for military service, and is put in the plural number like
‘stipendia' which means ‘campaigns,' that is properly the number of
times a soldier has earned pay. So ‘sacramenta’ would be the num-
ber of times he has taken the cath, which as long as he remaiued with
the army would ordinarily be only once, though thero were cases in
which it was repeated.

Convollcm ruris cinti] He says if any man robs him of his land,
removes his landmark. or denies his debis, he will have to go through
all the iaw's delays before he can get justice, which is promptly ad-
ministered iu campe. ‘Convallis’ is said to be properly a valley sura ”
rounded on all sides with hiils, and ‘vallis' one between two ranges.
The stone or other boundary by which private property was marked
off was sacred. The lands were in the first instance divided hythe
Agrimensores with religious ceremonies, and offerings were annualiy
made close by them to the god Terminus, whose image was often no
more than ashapeless stone. The neighbors met and offered sacrifice
jointly at the Terminalia. Cakes of iiour aud honey (liba) with
ground ‘far' (puls, xi. 58,) were commonly offered, and by those
who could afford it a lamb or young pig was added. '
