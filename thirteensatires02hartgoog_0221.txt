children3 no one would waste a dying hen or a qnsil on so useless a
friend. li a rich person ialls sicli, all offer vows; some promises
hecatomb; elephante are not leuty here, yet some would offer them,
or even their own children. 'iheruii the patient should get well, he
would anange to leave his money to Pacuvius, who prayed ior his
recovery (seint). Long live Pacuvius, with plenty oi gold, and not

1. Natali, unum, die] The welcoming ol the day that reminds us
ol our birth, and assigniug to ita glodness which it rarely inspires
aller childhood, is a conventionality as old es history. The Romans
irom the earliest times observed tbeir birtlrdays and those oi their
rulers and great men and their friends, as religious holidays, with
prayers and sannices, as we have seen in the lest satire, verse 84.
As to ‘caespes' turi altars were commonly used by persons of moder-
ate mesns.

3. Niueam Reginae discimus synam 5] White victims were offered io
the gods above, and black to those below, χθόνιοι. The worship of
Juno Regina was brought from Veii by Camillus, according to Livy,
and o temple was built to ihr under that name on the Aventine. Sho
who fought with the Gorgon (that ison her ‘aegis’l was Minerva,
to whom he has promised alike offering ior the preservation oi his
friend. The gods to whom they offered on such occasions were per-
haps chosen rather arbitrarily, or circumstances might direct the
choice in some instances. But Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva were conr·
monly worshipped together. The temple on the Capitoline hill con-
sisted oi three parts, oi which the middle was dedicated to Jupiter
Opt. Max, that on the right to J uno, ond the other to Minerva. The
Gorgon Medusa, whose head Perseus cut aff and Pallas placed u ιι
her‘aegis,' was by some traditions an inhabitant ol Africa, an so
Juvenal calls her ‘Maura' ‘Pugnanti Gorgone 'ie in construction
like ‘clipeo venientis et hasta’ (xi. 106, where see note); it means
“fighting armel with the Gorgon '' as the other is “coming armed
with shield and spear.'’ .

5. Sed procul extensum] Α young steer is tied and chafes attho
length oi the rope, nnd shakes his head, waiting to be offered to Jupiter
Opt. Max. It wss considered a good emenii the animal went will·
ingly to the altar. The Capitoline hill was also called Tarpeian from
the treacherous Tarpeia who betrayed the citaslel on thet hill to the
Sabines. The precipitous part of the hill from which criminals were
thrown was more especially known hy that name. ‘Sed' means only
that another victim was reserved ior Jove more fitting thsn the lamb.
‘coruscare' is the same as ‘vibrare' Wine was commonly poured
on the head oi the rictim before it vves killed, and ou the parts that
were sacriflced while they were hurningen the altar. They wem

also sprinkled with meal or rather broken breed (mola salsa) and
tipasam matris Ducere] The nreanings of the word ‘ducere’ are very
various. It here means, as it commonly does with ‘pocula' to drain.
