SATIRE Ι.

'rme satire must have been published atter aa). luo (aee note on
verse 47). Whether it was written first or not, it serves very well aa
an introduction to the volume. The ‘libellus' of which the author

I, too, have been to school ; rt paper must be wasted, why should not
I write (1-18)t How ean Ι restrain m seli when 1 think of the men
and the timeat Ihave no choice; must write satire. How, in
view of the eine ol today, can Ι take up the hackneyed tales ot the
old poete? In the very streete one sees his material. Honeety is
gone ; crimes alone help men. I must write aa I can (ta-80). All
the passione of men are my motley subject. When was there eo
much gaming aa there ie to-day‚ such luxury, such base cringing for a
paltry gaint Why, even men of rank eeek the dole and prese their
claim in every wey (at-126). So, every day, the sportula comes
first, then the court; then the hungry cliente go away disappointed,
and the rich man site down to his feast. But euch gluttony brings its
own epeedy punishment (rat-146). You tell me 1 had best be care-
ful how 1 speak, cr 1 may meet the Christians’ fate; that it is safer
to write of those who are dead and gone. Well, then, Ι must try
what Ι can do with those who are in their tombs (147-171).
