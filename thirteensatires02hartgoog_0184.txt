sarran v111. 165

30. generosum dixerit] ‘Generosus' as its derivatico shows, belongs
properly to descerlt. But, like εὐγενὴς, it came to have a wider sense.
A man might be ‘nobilis' without being ‘generosus,' the former
being nobility of personal distinction, the latter of patrician blood.
{he verb ‘ert' of the relative clause is to be supplied. See M.
79, obs.

32 Nonum cujusdam] In the later times of the republic and after·
warde it was the fashion for rich persons to have idiots, dwarfs, and
other defonnities in their houses to amuse them. The former were
called ‘moriones’ or ‘fatui' the latter ‘nani' ‘pumiliones,' or
‘pumili.' They were of either sex. The practice has been continued
to very late times, and is not unknown now, especially in the East.
‘Pravam' is ‘crooked,' and ‘extortam' is ‘twisted out of shapc,’
so there is not much difference.

38. ne tu eis Creticus aut Camerinus] Creticus was an agnomen of
the Caecilii Metelli first given to Q. Caecilius Metellus, who conducted
and brought to a successful conclusion the war with Crete, for which
he triumphed, rao. 62. The Caecilia gens was plebeian, but much
distinguished. Camerinus was the name of a good old family of the
patrician gens Sulpicia. Juvenal, aiter saying that things are called
by their opposites, adviser his friend not to be called a Creticus
or Crffmerinus, for the inferenoe would be that he war something
ver ow. ·

8y9. Rubelli Planta] C. Rubellius Plautus was descended through
his mother Julia from Tiberius, whose son Drusus was Julia’s father.
He incurred the jealousy of Nero, who caused him to be put to death,
ab. 62. Juvenal makes use of his name probably without thinking
much about accuracy, and though theman had been dead some years
he speaks of him as still alive. (ln ‘feceris’ in verse 41, see A. bl, 1,
R.; M. 349 and obs.; Z. 572. ‘Esses' takes its tense from ‘feceris'

'crode‘ 42. Ut te conciperet] . The man is as proud as if he had done some-
thing to deserve nobility, and to be born of anoblc mother retlrcr p,
'than of a poor woman working {wally-pay at the loom by tlte
‘agger' of Tullius, respecting which see note on v. 153. ‘Propter
quod' and ‘ut' are parallel, each introducing a purpose.

49. Nobilis in octi;] ‘Nobilis’ is not used as a substantive, and
‘indocti' does not agree with it as an adjective with a noun. It is
‘the nobleman who is unleamed,' as ‘jam veteres caecos' in vii.
170 is ‘blind men who are quite old.' ‘Quiritem’ is emphatic; heis
not only a man, but a Roman citizen, and worthy of being so. As to
‘plebe togata,' see i. 96. The poorer sort of people may have
been so called by the rich from their frequent appearance before

presence of their patrone.

⁵1. petit Euphraten juvenis] ‘ Juvenis' is a man of fighting age, and
