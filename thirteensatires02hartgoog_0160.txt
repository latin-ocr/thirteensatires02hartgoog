sarrae v. 141

Juvenal's conclusion is, that they who will put up with such treatment
deserve it; and the rich man is not much to blame if he despises those
who mli only drawn to his table by the nese, that is, by the savor of
his kitc en.

The satire has its moral for modern society, in which, if the relation
of host and guest is prevented by good breeding from taking tlte form
here represented, eating aud servility are scarcely less prominent
features than they were at Rome in its worst days. If the rich look
down upon the poor, it is usually because of the homage rank and
riches meet with ; and that this homage comes of sellishness none
know better than those who receive it. 'Phe coveting ofwhat is called
good society is the vice of a rotten system; and the man who seeke
company which does not want him has no reason to complain if his
pride is galled and his expectatione are disappointed. If there were
no Trebiuses in the world there would be no Virros3 so Juvenal
tlhoughm ‚and he does well to lay the chief weight of his satire upon
t e parasite.

The parasite, or dinerout, of later times, had no resemblance to the
client of the republic. He was no more than one of many in the traiu
of a rich men, or of us many rich men as he could get attached to in
that mean capacity. The old relation of ‘patronus’ und ‘cliens,' so
far as we can understand it, was simple and natural. The other was
the mere refuge of poverty, preferring the bread of idleness and a
false tongue to alife of honest labor and the rewards of an indepen-
dent mind. The student will only be misled if, following some of the
commentatore, he looks upon the latter condition as but another
phase of the former. Tlr'e old institution died out with the republic
to which it belonged; the modern practice was the fruit of human
corruption, and has its analogias in all ages of society, such as is
called civilized.

Aneuueur. -Men of honor, Trebius, would choose beggary rather
than such dependence as yours (1-11). For, first, when Virro invites
you to his board‚ he thinks that he lrasrepaid you forali your services
(12-23). Then, at dinner, you are served with poor wine which incites
you to quarrelling; he has the very best (24-37). Virro’s cups are
jewelled; you are hardly trusted with any thing but glass; and you do
noteven'drink the same water (at-53). You are waited on by aMoorish
runner ; he, by a fair youth of Ionia (ue-66). You must gnaw mouldy
breed, and not presumo to touch Virro'sloaf. This is all your reward
(et-79). Virro’s fish are the choicest, yours the poorest (80-106).
Virro’s unsocial arrogance, too, is worthy of a passing rebuke (idl-
113), While daintiee are carved for the host, you must look quietly
on (tlt-131). You would be differently treated if you were wealthy
and childless (132-145). The mushroome and fruits offered to you
differ from those which he has (146-155). He does all this on purpose
to mortify y0u; and you deservo to be treated like a slave, for such
you have made yourself (lto-173).
