is used proverbially) was Nero’s chief iuvetite, and his accomplice in
the burning of Rome. The origin of the fire was traced to his house.
To avert i'rom himself and his friend the odium of this crime, Nero, as
is weh known, charged it upon the Christiane, wbo were put to death& , . ’· ’

still greater variety of conjectures, in respect to ‘deducis,' involve the
passage in almost hopeless difficulty. It seems tomeun: “ After you
have been burned in the lire, you will be dragged through the midst γ ·‘

that the ‘sulcus ' is a stream or gutter formed by the melted pitch
running off the man's body on the ground. 1 do not see how ‘ sulcus'
can have that meaning. Madvig reads ‘deducit’ aud derives a nom· A ‚a
inative (quae taeda) from what goes before, and then supposes the aa(
furrow to be formed in the earth by a number oi victims buried up to
their waists in along row sud set on fire. Some take the meaning
to be ploughing the sand aud wasting labor. , ’
