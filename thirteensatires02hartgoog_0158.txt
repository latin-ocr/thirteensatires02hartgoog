112. Fuscum] Cornelius Fuscus was employed by Vespasium in high
commanda, and by Domitian as ‘praelectus' 01 the praetorias troops.
He was sent by him on an expedition against the Daci, and was killed,
together with the greater part 01 his army, by that people. Tacitus
describes him (in 1-0. 69) as ‘vigens aetate, claris natalibus,’ and as

one who loved danger for its own sake. J uvenal says he thought 01 ’

battles in his marble villa-5 retirement and the degrading 1110 01 a
Roman senator 01 11111 day did not suit him, and 110 was glad, no doubt,
to be em loyed on the rough service in which he lost his lise.

113. 19010010 Catulla] Fabricius Veiento, whom he calls ‘crafty,' is
mentioned above, iii. 185. Pliny describes Catullus as blmd and of a
sawage disposition. He had neither reverenee, modesty, nor pity, and
sp Domitian used him, aa a man uses 1110111, to shoot at all tha best
o men.

121 Sic pugnus Cilicis laudabat] 11 appears that Ciliciam gladiatore
were common. ‘Pegma‚' which hae its name from the Greek πηγ-
νύναι, was used 101 different things made 01 wood, but in connection
with the theatra. ‘Pegmata' were great worrdeu structures which
formed stages; and had two or more storias, which let up and down
by machinery. Upon these gladiatore fought, and other exhibitione
took place. The ⁴ velaria’ were an awning drawn over the seats 01
the amphitheatra to keep out the sun and rain. By some ingenious
contrivance, it appears, a boy was suddenly carried up 10 the awning

from the ‘pegma' 101 1110 amusement 011110 spectators; and this ·

blind flatterer pretended 1ο admira a thing he could not see, just as
now he admires the fish, looking to the len where it was not.
