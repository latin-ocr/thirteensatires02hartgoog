sarran 111. 123

is used to express a totally different relation between patron and de·
¹pendent from what it expressed in the earlier times o the republic.
At this time it did not involve a legal and political distinction, and
meant no more than a humble friend, a dependent who looked to
another for support, counsel, and ro forth. ‘Jacturam facere’ is to
throw a thing away so as to save the rest. It is an expression bor·
rowed from nautical languagc. ‘To throw a person overboard’ is a
common conversational phrase with us, meaning to get rid of him.
On ‘perierunt’ consult A. 58, 5, a; H. 471, 13 Β. 1095.

126. Quod porra officiam] He herc enters upon a subject we have
had before (i. 101). ‘Porro’ means ‘to proceed,’ ‘inthe next place.'
‘Ne nobis blandiar' is another way of saying ‘to speak the truth'
‘Si’ has the sense of ‘even if! There were at this time eiglrteen
praetore in the city. Each praetor had two lictors allowed him. ‘Ire
praecipitem jubeat' is a common expression of haste. ‘Orbus’ was
the legal word for a married person who had no children. The speaker
means to say these rich ladies have long been up waiting for their
visitors, and the praetor is in a fright lest one of his colleagues should
get to the house before him.

131. Divitis ln'r servi] ‘Claudere latus’ means in effect to give ths'
wall to a man with whom you are walking. See Horace, S. ii. 5. 17.
The ‘servus' is now a freedman, and the young gentleman is glad to
walt upon him. ‘Ingenuus' is one bom of free parents. ‘Alter'
means the freedman, and what follows is only away of saying he was

the pay of a tribune was, but we may concludo from this passage that
it was not a small sum compared with prices in these times.

133. Calvinae vel Catienae] These represent women of birth.

135. vestitisocies scorti] She in pursuit of her trade would appear
in a showy dress, carried about in a chair (i. 65, n), to invite and
be inspected by customers. Or else she sat in a. clrair in her house,
and those who came into admire must pay her well before she would
get down. To invite her from her sella, whichever it was, would be
the same as to consent to her price.

137. Da testem Romae] He goes on to say honest poor men are not
believed at Rome on their oath. By the host of the Idaean divinity,
Cybele, he means P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, who for his great merits
was chosen by the senate to escort the image of that goddess, which
was brought from Pessinus to Rome ac. 204. Numa was the most
pious of the kings. L. Caecilius Metellus, who triumphed during the
first Punic war, who was twice consul, once magister equitnm, dic·
tator, and for twenty-two years Pontifex Maximus, shortly after he
was chosen to be Pontifex rescued the palladium from the temple of
Vesta when that was on lire. He lost his sight on that occasion. The
Romans professed to have in the temple of Vesta the original Trojan
