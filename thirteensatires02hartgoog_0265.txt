monum. -All know my friend, what kind ol gods Egypt wor·
ships, crocodilea, the ibis, apes, even cats, river-iish, and dogs. They
may not eat onions or sheep, but human desh they may. When
Ulysses told such a story, it seemed more incredible than all his other
tales ; but that of which Ι tell was done publicly not long ago (1-32).
The people oi Ombi worship the erocodile; the people of Tentyra
wage war on them lor this. They surprise them as they are keeping
holiday, and attack them first with abuse, then with fists3 all this is
child’s play3 then they throw stones such as men, can liit in these
degenerata days, what must the gods think oi us (aa-tn! Part oi
the Omhites fly; the Tentyrites pursue. One of the Ombites falls ς
’ the enemy cut him up and eat him raw, without stopping to profane
lire. They never had a pleasanter meal; even the blood they serape
, up and lick from their fingers (72-92). In the extremity oi famine,
the Vascones once did a deed like this. We pardon them. They could
not have been Stolos then; now Gaul and Britain are learned natione.
But Egypt was more savage than those who offer human sacrifice.
What could have led this people to their crimel No barbarous nation
ever acted so cruelly as this useless cowardly hard (ea-131). Nature
has given men soit hearts and bidden them to weep. We differ from
beasts in having sympathy which leads us to dwell together, to stand
by each other, and to help the fallen. But now snakes and wild beasts
are inore harmonious than we ; men are not content to kill, they must
iidleiii other. What would Pythagoras say if he should see us

2. Crocodilon odorat] Herodotus mentions particularly the people oi
Thebes and those who lived near the lake Moeris as worshippers of
the crocodilo, while the people oi the island Elephantine (near Syene)
did not think it sacred, and even ate the flesh. The town, which alter
the time oi Ptolemy Philadelphus bore the name Arsinoe, in ancient
times was called the city oi crocodilos. Herodotus describes the ibis,
and he says the Egyptians honored it because it destroyed the flying
snakes that came over from Arabia, and it came to be generally be
lieved that this bird fed upon sliakes. But the ibis is not capable of
eating snakes, and this is as iabulous as the winged snakes themselves.
It is supposed the Egyptians reverenced this bird because it carne to
the country about the time oi the rising of the Nile. It was not a
native oi Egypt. There are mummies of the ibis, and itis very
common on Egyptian monuments. lts worship was universal in
Egypt. ‘Adorat' seems to be used comically oi that which is repul.-
sive, and ‘pavet' oi that which is harmless.

· 4. cercopitheci] The cynocephalus'or dog-headed ape was sacred to. ¹

Thoth, the god oi letters, whom the Greeks identified with Hermes.
He was worshipped in particular at Hermopolis in Middle Egypt. The
cercopithecus was a long-tailed ape (κέρκος, πίθηκος), and such have
been iound embalmed.

5. Dimidio magicae resonant} The most remarkable remains of
Thebes on the western side oi the Nile are' two seated colossal ligures.
One is covered with ancient inscriptions cut by visitors, which show it
