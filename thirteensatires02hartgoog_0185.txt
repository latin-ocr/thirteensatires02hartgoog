never strictly tributary to the Romans. ln the years an. 69, 70, they
carried on a sharp struggle ior independence under a native chief
Civilis. They were at last put down. The satire, therefore, was
written alter this war. ‘Aquilae' is put ior the army leit alter the
outbreak to prevent a recurrence of it.

5³. truncoque siint'llimua Horace] This seems to have been prover·

,nial ‘Hermae ''were busts; properly, but not necessarily, of Hermes
or Mercurius, which, like the Greeks, the Romans used to ornament
garricus, to mark boundaries, and lor other purpcses. ‘ Truncc ¹ only

63. Hie· ilai] Lipsius gives au inscription which he says he saw and
copied at ome, by which it appears that lllrpinus was the son of
Aquilo, a celebrated racer. The stone Lipsius describes was a curicus
one. lt had the ligure ol a man cl the lled fection standing in the
middle, witha stiek in his right hand and some hay in the leit, and
tuo horscs jumping upon him, cneori each side; thessere the sire

‘Nepos is the name of a baker. There were haud-mille and mills
