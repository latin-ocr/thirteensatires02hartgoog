262. Ergo omnia Florae] As to the Megalesia or festival of Cybele,
see xi. 1933 they were celebrated in the early part of April. The
Floralia were celebrated at the end of the same mouth, and were at-

: ' tended with very wauton exhibitione. The Cerealia also were beldin

April, and lasted one day. There were plays acted at all these festivals,
and thetis the meaning of ‘aulaea'

sosyacum petomo corpora] ‘Petaurum' is a Greek word hidaspen,
equivalent to μετέωρον, ‘up in the air! It appears to mean a· stage
from which persons took flying leaps. There was a spring perhaps
which helped the jumper, and explains ‘jactata corpora in this place.
In some cases a wheel was used, on the opposite sides of which two
persons hung, it would seem, and as the wheel went round one went
up and the other down. The ‘ rectus funis ' is the tight rope. ‘Funam-
buli' or σχοινοβίιτιιι, as the Greeks called thern (iii. 77), carried their
art to great perfectiori at Rome. .

267. Corycia semper qui puppe] Corycia is-put for Cilician, Corycus
being a promontory of Cilicia. Among the products of that country

largelyerrported to Rome was saffron. This explains ‘sacci olentis‚' .

the sweet-srnelling bag. Corus and Auster are storm winds.
2⁷1. Passum et municipes Jovis] ‘Passum' was ‘raisin wine‚' for
which Crete was famous. The name is derived from ‘pando' he-
· cause the grapes were spread out to dry. The Cretans had a Zeus of
their own. Rhea, to save the child she was ready to give birth to
.from his father Cronos, hid herself in a cave of Mount Dicte or Ida
in Crete, with which island the early years of Zeus are commonly
connected (see xiii. 41). The wine-jars therefore are said to be coun-
ετγηὲθη of Jove's, as the ‘silini' are called ‘ municipes’ of Crispinus
iv. '3). ·
ί 272. Hic tamen] Thetis, the ‘funambulus' The merchant follows
his rash trade to geta great deal of money and a great many houses,
while the other follows his to keep out cold and hunger. ‘Es' must
be understood after ‘ temerarius!

276. plenum ruogois trabibus sturm] ‘Trebs' is sometimes used for a
ship. Juvenal says there are more men at sea thanon shore. The
use of the comparative where one-branch of the comparisonis not
expressed is common. The Carpathian sea was named from the island
Carpathos directly between Rhodes and Crete. Gaetulia hordered on
the Atlantic and not on the Mediterraneum but ‘ Gaetuli' is commonly
used for the Africana, and here ‘ Gaetula aequora ' is put loosely for
the African waters of the Mediterrancan. Mons Calpe is the present
Rock of Gibraltar. Juvenal says this multitude of ships will pass the
pillars of Hercules (of which Calpe was one and Abyla on the African .
coast was the other) and hear the sun hissing ashe sets in the western

gatep‘skgbe final vowel in ‘ Culpe' is short, though it represents the
ree πη.
