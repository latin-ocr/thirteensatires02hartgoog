212. meliorem praesto nsopistro] ‘Praesto ' is 'I warrant,' and ‘fore’ ’

may be supplied aiter ⁶ meliorem! He says to the father he need not
be iu 0 hur-ry; he may go away and make himself easy; his son is
certain to turo out a good scholar and surpass his toacher as 101 as
Ajaxlsurpassed his father Telamon, and Achilles l'elcus. lle adds
sarcastically, “ you 1111101 1101 prees the young mind; his marrow is not
yet thoroughly saturated with the atrocities 01 matured vice3 when he
comes 10 rnan’s estate he will be ripe t'or all that is wicked.’' ’1110011-
pression ‘ nondum implevere medullas' is something like that in the
book 01 1011 (xx. 11) : “Η1011011000101111101 thesin of his youth.”

220. Elatum jam crede aarum] “ You may consider your daughter-
in-law as good as dead and buried 11 0110 brings your son a large por-
tion.” Except under special agreement before marriage the wrt‘e's
‘dos' went back 10 1101 relations at her death. llere theman must
0001110011 interest in tho pro erty at his wife's deuth, orit would be
11111111111111111111111101011113ῗέξέ1111111
almost see theman clutching 1110 wife's throat.

225. theudace] ‘Mandare' is used here like ‘ 11011010ν forteaching
(000 above, verse 3, n).

228. pueros producit evorea] ‘Producere 'is hene to educate. The
change of tense from ‘praecepit’ should be observed, as denoting a
course of training on 0 principle once laid down. The next line is
omitted in some MSS, but 1101 in the best. It has no grammatical

Ἴ connection with the sentence} either therefore another line hasbeen

lost 01 this is the work 01 an interpolator who sorgot to finish the mis·
chief he had begun. The language in 230, sqq, 10 taken, 00 is manifest,
from the chariot races.

23]. quem si revoces] The antecedent to ‘quem ' is easily supplied
by substituting ‘ juveni' 101 ‘curriculo' The 01101101 represents the
son, who is the real subject 01 the sentence. So immediately below
(verse 2411 101 an antecedent 10 ‘quorum' ‘Thebanos’ must be suh-
stituted 101 ‘ Thebas,' which is the same thing, 00 ‘civitas’ is equiva-
lent sometimes to ‘cives‚’ πόλις 10 11011101, and 00101111. The change
of person in ‘revoces' only makes the sentence more pointed. ‘Nes-
cit is used as Horace and others use ‘nescius' ‘Revoces’ isin the
subjunctive of 0 general condition,· 15115, a. ‘Permittas' ie the
subjunctive hy attraction3 Α. 66, 2. Neither construction is unusual.

234. adeo indulcant sibi latirus ipat] ‘Adeo’ belongs to ‘indulgent;'

, ‘¹ so determined are they to take a wider indulgence without asking

your leave '' (ipsi). With ‘stultum' in the next verse we must supply
esse eum)

237. et circumscribere] See 11222. Before ‘quantus,' ‘tantus' must
be supplied. See note on x.13. As to the Decii, see viii. 254, n.
Menoeceus the 001101 Creon was said to have sacrificed himself when
Thebes 1100 besieged by the seven chiefs. Teiresias the seer pro-
phesied that if he did so the Thebans would gain the victory. Juvenal
likes 0 stroke at ¹Greek history 1 see 11. 1741 ; he therefore goes out 01
his way. and having spoken of Thebes he adds the legend 01 Cadmus
