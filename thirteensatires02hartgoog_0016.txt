Hadrian mn. ᾖ. when Juvenal was, according to this
sketch, eighty or a little more.

Thus the statements of the Grammarians in respect to
the poet’s age, and of that writer who says he died of old
age in the time of Antoninus Pius, would be borne out.
Ihave also allowed the fact of an honorable hanishment
into Egypt, though not the cause assigned by the Gram-
marians (the supposed attack on the pantomimo Paris),
which is impossible. That Juvenal did not professedly -
composa satira till late in lise, is admitted and accounted
for. Likewise that he may have written verses before he
ventured to publish them, and that some of these were
afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is allowed. Itis
also admitted that he attended the usual schools in early
life, and practised rhetoric till middle age. chond these
facts tho Grammarians, I believe, have been misled.

’ · Independently of the chronological difficulties in respect
to Paris, it does not appear that the versas quoted by the
Grammarians (vii. 90-92) were ever intended as asatire cn
him, but if any thing asa compliment. So at least they
appear in the connection in which we have them. And it
is parfectly clear that in that connection they could not
have given offence to the emperor, whoever he was, since
the Satira sets out from thc first with such praisc as the
worst of these princes covetcd and rewarded, praise for

¹ his exclusive support of learning. If therefore it had been

ὲ possible toadmit these verses as the cause of Domitian’s

’ displaasurc, it must have been when they appeared sepa-
= rately as an epigram, or with a different context from the

present, which it must he admitted they do not very well ¹
suit, it as sccms certain, the rest of the Satira was written

long alter Paris’s death.
