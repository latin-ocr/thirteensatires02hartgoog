mark, but whether these barbarians came from thence is adifficult
question. The Britones are the same here as the Britanni. There
can be no doubt that our ancestors are ineant, whose human sacrifices
gave them a bad name. The Agathyrsi Herodotus describes as per·

Mollissina corda] Nothing can be more touching and manly than
the verses that follow. Their style is that 01 nature, and there is no
satire so strong as that which brings the pure emotions 01 nature into
contrast with the bad passions end sices 01 mankind. We come with

pleasant surprise npon a sentiment so true and simply expressed after
the revolting picture that has gone before. It is a satisfacuonlto know
