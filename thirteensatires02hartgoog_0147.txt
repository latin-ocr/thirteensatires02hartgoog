223. Si potas avelli Circensibus] The Ludi Circenses, or Magni, took
place annually, and were of the highest antiquity, having been first
celebrated by Romulus, as the tradition went, cn the occasion oi the
rape of the Sabine women, under the name of Consuaha. They con-
sisted of horse, chariat, and foot races, sham fights, both land and
water, wrestling, boxing, and fighting with beasts, as well as ieats of
horsemanship such as are witnessed in modern circuses. These were
performed in the Circus Maximus, the vast building erected, according
to tradition, by Tarquinius Priscus between the Aventina and Palatina
hills. The passion of the Romans for these exhibitions was very
strong. Juvenal has many allusione to this. ‘Avelli' is in themid-
dle voice.

optima Sorae Aut Fabrateriae] ‘Paratur' is opposed to ‘conducis;’
one is ‘to buy,' the other ‘ to hire! The three towns here mentioned
were in Latium; Sora was on the Liris, and still retains its name;
part oi the walls also are still in existence. Fabrateria was a town
also on the banks ot the Liris, hut about twelve miles lower down, by
the junction of that river and the Trerus'. Frusino was situated half·
way between Fabrateria and Ferentinum, also on the Via Latina, and
onfthe right bank of the Cosa, a tributary of the Trerus. Cicero had
aarmt ere.

2³2. sed illum] This is a sort of parenthesis, and meant tor another
stroke at town living, where people eat all manner of food and go to
bed with it undigested. ‘Sed’ is commonly so used. Compare M.
437, a. ‘Nam' takes up the sentence from ‘vigilanda' and explains
the reason ol that general assertion. ‘Imperfectus' is undigested
and indigestible. ‘Ardenti stomacho’ is a ieverish stomach. Indi·
gestion brings on the illness, and want of sleep kills the patient. ‘Plu-
rimus ' does not strictly agree with ‘aegea' which is an adjective. It
is used absolutely ; ‘manya man, being sick.' The last syllable in
‘vigilando' is short by exception. M. 19, 4, obs.; Α. ειδ, 297, lt. 2.
‘Peperit’ is aorist.
