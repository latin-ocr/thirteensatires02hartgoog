viii 1110 os auvnusn.

of Juvenal's personui character it is not very easy to
forman estimato from his writings. That his invectives
against the vices 01 his time arc not the 111010 artistic
and declamatory compositions which some writers suppose
them to be, but the fruits of an honest indignation, of rare
powers of saroasm, and 010 large knowledge of the world,
I think is manifest. His language is unreserved in dealing '
with the foulest vices, but there is 110 appearance 01 his
being himselfa loose liver in any part of his writings.
When Horace is ecanae, he betrays something 01 sympathy
with vioe, while Juvenal shows only contempt 101 ia
Although therefore an expurgated edition 01 Juvenal.
would have more gaps than an expurgated edition 01 =
Horace, a well-regulated mind would be less offendsd
with the entire text 01 Juvenal than with that 01 Ηο1000.“
J uvenal's morality was of a higher and less technieal sore
than Horace’s, and 1100 led some into the notion that he
drew it 110111 the purest source, and was in understanding,
¹ if 1101 by profession, a Christian. This of course is absurd. ,
Hc knew human nature, and he knew right 110111 wrong, l
and was 1101 blinded by aelf-indulgence, and 00 was able
to state the law of conscience in away to astonish some
Christians to whom that law is very imperfeetly known.
Apart from his morality, Juvenal was a great master 01
words, and hada largo fund of illustration. His picturas , ³
drawn from real life, asI have observed iu the course of ·
the notes, are particularly happy; whether they represent
the common room 01 0 tavern, or the deek of a ship, 01
the inside 010 00111101θο hut or 010 camp, ora school-roem,
01 the greedy crowd at the sportula, or the 0110010 01
Rome, or a drunken brawl, these and a hundred other
soenes are so drawn that an artist would have no difficulty
