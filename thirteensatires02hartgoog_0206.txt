were islands in the Cyc es gronp, to which criminals were trans-
ported. Sariphus was the larger ot the two, and about twelvs miles
in circumference.

1⁷1. afipalr's munitam] The city ot Babylon is said to have been
built ot brick cemented with asphalt by Semiramis. Here Alexander
died, rac. 323, in his thirty-third year. A ‘sarcophagus' was prop
erly a coffin composed oi a particular stone from Assos in Troas,
which was said to consume the body (σάρκα φαγεῖν).

· 17³. Quantulasint hominum corpuscula] This idea isafavorite one
with the oets. The best-known allusion to it isin Shakespeare's
Henryl .P. i. Act v. Sat:

“Fare thee well, great heartl
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunkl
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces of the vilest sarth
Is room enough.”

174. Veliflcotas Athea] To avoid the catastrophe that happened to
Mardonius, whose fleetwaswrecked there in the first expedition of
Darius against Greece (nc. 492), Xerxes ordered the low isthmus οῖ’
the peninsula (Acte) to be cut through, and a canai was made capable
ot floating two triremes abreast. This was in rac. 490. Juvenal treats
the matter as an invention; but the canal has been recently traced.
The idiom has been noticed before. See A& S. 274, 2, R. 5; H.

1⁷5. constratam elassibus r'sdanrp¹ This refers to the bridge of beata
across the Hellespont, built of t e same ships which sailed through
Athos. Herodotus speaks ol several rivers (the Scamander in Asia,
and others in Thrace, Thessaly, and Achaia) being dried up hythe
enormous host of Xerxes drinking oi them1 This is easily explained.
These rivers are not perennial streams tun of waler. The army could
find water-heles only in many of them, and these they may have
exhausted. Sostratus seems to have been a poet who wrote of the
exploits of Xerxes. ‘Madidis alis ' is supposed to mean that he got
heated with the exertion of reciting his poetry. This is not a satisfac·
tory explanation, and the words may mean that his ssight was not a

wind, as Eurus is the southeast. He flogged whatever wind opposed
him. This may be a playlul invention ol Juvenal’s, making Xerxesa
harder master to the winda than Aeolus himself, who was stern enough
according to Virgil. Xerxes’s castigation and chaining of the Hel-
lespont for breaking down his bridge are told by Aeschylus and
Herpldopup¹ Juvenal produced Homer’s epithet for Poseidon, the
