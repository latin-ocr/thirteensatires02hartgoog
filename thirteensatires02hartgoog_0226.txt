89. Hic omnam placabo Jooemd The Penates of a house included one

or more of the Dii Magni as we as the Lares, the spirits oi their good ·

ancestors. tupiter, luno, Minerva, and Vesta, one or all, were most
commonly included. ‘Operari ' is commonly used for offerin'g sacdllce,
or the performanoe oi a religione duty. Here he means his (1001- ig
doing· its duty with its early morning lamps.

95. Libet exundare] “I shall be glad to see who will expend a sick
hen, just closing its eyes, ona friend so fruitless as this.'' Cocks or
bens were offered to Aesculapius in particular, but also to the Lares
and other gods. Quails and sparrows were types of debauched
passion, and were never very well thought of. ⁴ Cadere’ is a common
’ word in connection with sacrifices.

98. Sarrtlre colman] He says it a rich person without children takes
a lever, men hang their walls with tablets inscribed with prayers lor
his or her recovery, and vows of sacrifices, or whatever it might be,
ii the prayer should be granted. These tablets were common on all
occasions of this sort or of other important prayers, and they were
. hung up in the house ol the person praying, or in the temples, or on
the statues of the gods; see x. bb. Tablets so inscribed were also
carried before the victims to the altar. All such vows were made in
public, a principle observed generally in respect to prayer, which was
held suspicions if it were secret. It should be noticed as a peculiar
construction that the verb in verse 99 is singular though the adjec-
tive ‘orbi' is plural. ·

101. exsistant qui promittant hecatomben] ‘Exsistunt qui' cannot
properly be said to stand for‘sunt qui! “Persona start up who
promise a hecatomb (that is a hundred bulla), since elephante are not
for sale iu these parts, and are not bred in Latium or anywhere under
our skies.'' He means if there were elephante they would have been
vowed instead. ‘Nec venales' is opposed to ‘nec concipitur,' and
‘aut' joins ‘Latio' and ‘nsquam' The change to the finite construo·
tion ‘bellua concipitur,' where ‘concepti' (elephanti) would be ex-
pected, is a common Latin usa e (compare xi. 32).

los sed firrvu pente petito? ‘Petita' agrees with ‘bellua,’ and
¹ Caesaris armentum' is in apposition with it. ‘Furva gente' are the
Indians. He says thc emperors kept herds of elephanta anthe country
of the Rutuli in the neighborhood of Lavinium 1n Lunum, where
Turnus was king. They were kept for public shows. These beasts are
not prepared to serve any private person, since their ancestors obeyed
the orders of Hannibal (whom he calls, Tyrius, as Carthage was a
Phoenician settlement), and Roman generals, and Pyrrhus, the krng
of Epirus, to which country the Molossi belonged. It was he who
first brought elephanta over into Italy, and the battle oi Heraclea
(no. 280), when it was almost decided against irim, he turned with
his reserva ol elephanta, which the Roman cavalry would notiace.
Livy describes how Hannibal gothis elephants over the Rhone. They
were thirty-seven in number. The appearance of these animals helped
him in crossing the Al sby the terror they struck into the moun-
taineers. They sulio terribly on that mmch. Livy says that the
