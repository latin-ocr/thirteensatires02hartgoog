208 noras.

Romans first used elephants in the war against Philip of Macedon,

ι rac. 200. This wa's the year efter the conclusion of the second Punic

war, in which Livy says these elephante were taken. Pliny says

that elephants were first exhibited in the Circus in the year no. 99..

The last syllahle in ‘belli' (verse 1¹⁰fo preserved from elision.
111„ Nulla igitar raom per Novium] hrs means that Novius and

Pacuvius (who may be anybody) are {uite ready, and the difficulty is

not on their part isit is not done, to ο er elephante on the altar of Gal·
lita's Lares. On the use of ‘quin' see A. 65, 1, b ; M. 375, c; Z. 543.

11⁵. Alter eninr, si concedas] ‘Enim’ means they would not hesitate
about an elephant, for one of them would be quite ready to offer
hurrran sacrifices for the life of the rich woman, or even his own child,
as Agamemnon did, though he could not expect her to be delivered
and a hind substituted in her placeas the story is about Iphigenia.
‘Tragicae' means that this is the story in the Tragedians. The onence
requiring ‘piacuhrm' was that Agamemnon had not fulfilled a vow he

’ hed made to Artemis to offer to her the most beautiful thing that

should be bom in the year his daughter was born; he or the Argives
had also shot a hind loved by Diana. For the 'subjunctive in ‘conce-
dats,' see references on x. 142. ‘Pueris et frontrbus ancillarum’ is for
‘frontibus puerorum et ancillarum.' ,

121. Larem meam avens] So the master commended the uniust
steward because he wsswrse in his generation. He says ironically
that the safety of a thousand ships (referring, perhaps, to Agamem-
non's lieet, for the safety of which he sacriflced his daughter) is noth·
ihng coirlrlrpared lvytith atpill, for if fhihmdsffan renova} he will unmake
1s w ,ca m esuareo e erman. ‘ assa’rs asnare
made of οείἓξ, and so contrived that the fish thet got in could not get
out again. ‘Libitina' was tire goddess of funereis and all things per·
taining to the dead. She is identified by some authors with Proserpina,
and by others with Venus.

124 Post meritum sane mirandum] After a service truly astonishing,
thetis the effectual vows of Pacuvius, to which heis ready tc attrib-
ute his recovery. For this service, he will perhaps, make-him his

« sole‘heres’ (heres ex asse). ‘Breviter,'‘in few words! ‘Rivalibus'

ishere used in an uncommon wey. Its derived sense elsewhere has
reference only to rivahy in love. ι

ns. Ergo vides qaam Grande] “ So you see what a return for his
sufferings the death of one Mycenaeae damsel won.'' He supposes
hrm tc heve had e ‘nubilis Iphigenia,' end to have sacrificed her, and

tc have hed his trouble soothed hythe fruita of his devotion in the
' old man's will. Iphigenia is represented in the story as having been
sentior to Aulis by her father under the pretence that she was to be
married to Achilles. ‘Mycenis’ is an adJ'ective.

128. rel Nestora totam] See x. 2415. “Let him live a whole
Nestor.” The accusative is that oi kindred signification. Nero's
motta wass “Hoc agamus ne quis quidquam habeat,'' ‘⁴ let it be our
endeavor that no one shall have any thing.'’ He robbed provinces, and
he robbed rich citizens. No oue could call his money his own.
