32. Quanto Faesidium laudat] Faesidius isa ‘causidicus’ but a man
of substance, who has clients that come into court and applaud him
loudly. ‘Sportrda' means the cliente who get the ‘sportida' (i. 95,
n). The omission ol ‘tanto’ before ‘quanto' is common (see x.
13). Pliny describes with a good deal oi disgust how young men with
no qualifications thrust themselves into the inferior courts, and adds
what is to the oint here: that these pleaders are followed by auditors
ol a like kind), slaves whom they have hired lor the purpose ; they
collect in the middle ot the besides, where the ‘ sportula' is served out
to them as openly as in the diningroom: these follows go about from
court to court lor the same pay (the ‘sportula'l, from which they
have got the natue συφοκλεὶς (because they cried σοφῶς, as we say
, ¹ bravo ’J or in Lptin ‘pradicant’

“ 40. Saturnus stipans] That is, before Satmnus was driven from
Olympus by Jupiter and took to the resping-hook in Latium, where

he taught the natives agriculture and became king of the country. He '

is usually represented witha reaping-hook in his hand. The Greek
legende varied es to the place where Zeus was brought up when his
mother Rhea hid him from his tather Cronus. The common story
was that she took him to Crete, where he was educated. Ida was a
mountain mass ol considerable height in Crete. See xiv. 271, n.

42. Nullo super naba] These leasts of the gods belong, he means,
to a later age than that of Saturnus, to the age oi heroes, which He·
siod places the fourth in his list. ‘Puer lliacus'is Ganymedes. He
is represented as the son oi Tros, or of llus the son ol Tros. Either
way Troas was his native country. and he was carried off, according
to the common account, from the Trojan Ida. He is said to have suc·
cceded Hebe as cupbearer of the gods. She was a daughter of Jupi-
ter and duno, and became the wite of Hercules. ‘Ad cyathos' is the
ordinary way oi expressing this office.

44. etjam siccato uectore] ‘ llt’ sometimes follows ‘ nec' to carry on
the negation. See Krueger, Lat. Grammatik, 533, Anna 4,a,3. duve-
nal groups Hebe and Vulcan together, and they make a picturesque
contrast. He eomes in reeking from his work. She is at her task on
Olympus, and hands him a cup to relresh him, which he first drains
and then wipcs off the sweat lrom his black arms. All this Juvenal
says was alter the simple days of Saturnus.

46. Prondebol aliquisque deca} ‘Each god dined by himself! He
says ‘prandebat’ because the ‘prandium’ lwhich we call luncheon)
was a plain meal. The dative seems to be that “ of advantage.’' See
A. bl, 7, and note. Juvenal is ridiculing the polytheism ol the poets
and the gigantis system of vice sanctioned by divine example.

47. Talis ot est lodiepl‘ Talis ’ is equivalent to ‘tanta' This use of the
word is less common w ere only quantity and not quality is expressed.
