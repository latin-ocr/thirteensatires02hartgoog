by others to belong to the reign of Hadrian, that is not far from the
time when this satire was written. The cathedral of Tivoli is built on
the inundatione of the temple of Hercules, who was worshipped above
other gods at Tibur. The enormous buildings erected by Hadrian at
the foot of the hille of Tibur could hardly have been built when Juve
nal wrote these verses, or they would probably have been referred to,
for iu magnificence they surpassed any thing in Italy. Their ruins are
the admiration oi travellers. -

91. Ut spado vincebat] Posides was 0 freedman of Claudius the
emperor, favored and afterwards suspected by him. Where he built
his magnificent house does uot appear. lt may hare been near his

Praeneste and Tibur; but large temples of ‚tupiter in other towns,
besides the great temple in Rome, were sometimes called Capitolium.
The plural is used (as in x. bb) because of the tripartite character 01
the building (xii. 3, 0.).

93. Fregit opes] This is the common verb in this case. We use the
same when we speak of breaking.

94. turbavit filias amena] See vii. 129, “Sic Pedo conturbat.'' The
use 01 ‘dum ³ with the present followed by a verb in the perfect tense,
which here occurs twice over, is common. See A. ts, 2, e ; H. 467, 43
and compare i. 59, and elsewhere.

traveller where he may quench his thirst. The Romans might be for-
given for this interpretation of the law of Moses when the Jews’ own
traditione and teachers told them they must love their neighbor aud
hate their enemy (see St. Matt. v. 43); arrd Jew and Samariten
thought it strange that our Saviour asked for water from a Samariten
woman and talked with her. The old law was not of this tenor. “If
