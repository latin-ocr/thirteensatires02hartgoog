106. Asucr'e jactare manua] Bringiug the hand to the lips and kiss-
ing it, to throw the kiss towards apersou, was a mark of respect.
‘Adorare’ is derived from this custom‚ which is ot Eastern origin.
With us it implies more familiarity than it did with the ancients.

108. Si trulla inverso] ‘'Trulla,' which is connected with the Greek
τρύβλιον, is used ior a drinkiugcup and a washing-basin. It seems
here to be used for a more hemely vessel.

110. Noa niatronaLoris,] ‘Laris’ means ‘a man’s house) ‘Sponsus'
was one who was betrothed to a woman, as ‘sponsa' was a woman
who was betrothed to a man. A youth could not contract marriage
till he had ceased to be ‘impubes' the time of which was not strictly
defined, but was generally taken to be fourteen. But a contract oi
marriage might be made atter seven, and a child might so be ‘spon-
sus’ By a law passed in the time ot Augustus, a girl might not be
betlomed till she was teu, the age oi puberty being twelve from the
eariest times. ’

114. aeusi Gymnasia It is doubted whether this means ‘pass by,’
that is, ‘say nemore o the gymnasia, and let us go on to a crime oi
a larger sort;' or whether it should be rendered, ‘let us pass on to
the schools, and speak oi a crime committed by one oi your greater
philosophers’ as if it were ‘transi ad gymnasia? The latter construc-
tion seems preferable. The philosophers' schools were called ‘gym-
nasia’ because they commonly held them in buildings ereeted for
gymnastic exercises. ‘Crimen majoris abollae' the Scholiast says
was a proverb. The origin oi the saying, I think, must remain doubt·
iul.¹ It means in some way or other a greater crime. ‘Abolla’ which
is derived from ἀμβολλίι, a torm oi ἀναβολὴ, is used in the next Satire
(iv. 75), and theu it is worn by a senator. It was probably used indis-

,criminately for the outer garment worn out oi doors, whether
‘lacema’ ‘pallium' or whatever it might be, or the military ‘sagum'
116. Stoicus occidit Baream] Servilius Barea Soranus was proconsul

¹ of Asia in the reign of Claudius, anda man of high character. He

tell under the displeasure ol Nero, and was charged with treasonable
practices, aud his daughter Servilia with aiding him. They were cou-
demned to death. The chief witness against them was P. Egnatius
Celer, who was afterwards, in Vespasian’s reign, charged with this
offence by Musonius Rufus, and was condemned to death.

117. ripa nutritus in illa] The Scholiast says this was the city of

Tarsus, which was situated on the banks ot the Cydnus in Cilicia, and
was supposed to have been founded by Perseus. Pegasus, who is said
to have sprung from the blood of the Gorgon Medusa, when Perseus
slew her at Tartessus in Spain, is supposed to have dropped a hoof
here (ταρσός), and thus to have given its name to the city. Tarsus
was famous tor its schools oi learning, which were second to noue in
the world.
· 120. Protogenes alv'quz's] All these are Greek names representing
parasitos, who· contrived to monopolize their great friends as only
Greeks were wont (‘ gentis vitio ').

125. jactura clientis] It must be remembered that the word ‘cliens'
