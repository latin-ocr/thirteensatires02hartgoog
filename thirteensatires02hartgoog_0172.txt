62 saturest qnam dicit Horatius, Eune! ] The reference is to Hor. O.
ii. 19. 7. There is no doubt that Horace wrote all his odes aiter he
had got a competence3 andis his poverty made him write in the first ¹

instance, what he wrote then was of a different character.

· 64 dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque] Cirrha was situated at the head of the
hay called Sinus Crissaeus, in the Corinthian Guls. On the high
ground above it was the more ancient city of Crissa, oi which it was
the port. Orissa was the original seat of the worship of Apollo, aiter-
wards transferred to Delphi in its neighborhood ; and in this way Cirrha
came to be associated with Apollo, who is the ‘dominus Cirrhae ’ here
referred to. Nysa is a name given to sevend places where Bacchus
was worshipped, having originally belonged to that (wherever it was]
which reared him ,as a child. The locality oi the original Nysa issilamss‘rd
generally placed by the poets in tbe Punjaub. ·‘ Feruntur,' ‘are carried
away, borne headlong;' the word is used for madness or (as here) in·
spiration or other strong excitament. ‘Dominis' seems best taken as
an ablativa of means or instrumental case, as in i. 13.

66. lodice peranda Attonitae] ‘Lodix' is a blanket or other bed-
covering. ‘Attonitae' is used for ‘perplexed' lt is equivalent to
tydpldvrnroaand represents one inspired. ‘Aspicere’ is in apposition
wit ‘o ns.

68. utrium confundat Erinnys] This is Alecto, whom Juno mered
to inflame Turnus with jealousy when Latinus gave his daughter ,

Α Laviniaterneas. See Virg. Aen. vii. 420, sqq. 'In vaano he says,
“geminos erexit crinibus angues Verberaque insonuit rabidoque haec
addidit ore; '' and elsewhere from the top of a roclr she sonnds a
blast upon her horn at which the foresta and rivers are startled,
mothers press their babes to their bosom, and all the country people
are rouscd to arms. All this roaring and snake-liftingthe poet would
not have been able to invent if he had not been¹ in easy circumstances,
if he had not had aslave or two anda pretty good house. Virgil
had a good deal more than this.

69. tolerabile deesset] The verb must be pronounced in two syllables,

¹ lsryifylniffsibs. For the tense, see M. 347, b, obs. 25 A. 59, 3, c, A&

71. ’rS'urob aibr] emeret prave bronna] ‘Surdus' isused for one dumb
as wellas deal. he ‘buccina' or ‘bucina’ was the oldest wind in·
strument, and was a ruder sort of ‘comu'

'72 Rubrenus Lappa cothurno] This is some anull play-writer of the
day. He says we expect such a man as this, who is obliged to pawn
his dishes and his cloak while he is employed upon his play, to rise to
the dignity ol the old tragedy.

¹79. jaceat Laconas in hortu] The poet M. Annaeus Lucanus inherited
a large fortune from his father, the brother oi Seneca, who wasa .
native of Corduba in Hispania, and collectores the imperial revenues.
He is said to have died at the age of 26, an. 65, in consequence oi
having taken part in Piso's conspiracy against Nero. Το avoid the
executioner he opened his own veina. He was therefore dead when
this satire was written. We know nothing of Serranus. Saleius is
mentioned by Tacitus as an unsuccessful writer.
