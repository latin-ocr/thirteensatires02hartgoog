95. Et phthisis et minicae patres] ‘Consumption and putrid abscesses
aud a broken leg’ (xv. 57, n).

96. Sunt taitok] ‘Tanti’ may be translated “are worth bearing,?'

where we understand readily that they are worth bearing for the sake
of money. lt may not be easy to extract this meaning i‘rom the sen-
tence grammatically, but Madvig (in bis ‘Opuscula 'l bas shown by
abundant examples that ‘tanti,' which at first meant the worth oi the
thing sor which a price is given, carne conventionally to be joined with
the price itseli aa here· An instance oi the primary use ot' ¹ tanti ' is
found in iii. 54: “Tanti tibi non sit opaci Omnis arena Tagi-ut '
somno careas.'’ Madvig resera to x. 97: ‘⁴ Sed quae praeclara et pros·

lowed the common reading ‘tanturn ’ there.
' 97. Nec dubitet Ladas] Not even Ladas would hesitate to pray for
the rich man’s gout, unless he is mad. There were two celebrated
Greek runners oi this name, whichwas proverbial in this line. Gout, ·

a physician.. The final ‘e' is long, corresponding to the Greek form

abounded in helleboro, the supposed remedy i'or insanity. Horace
, allodes to it more than once.

.99. Pisaeae ramas elisaei] The plain of Olympia, in which the
Olympio games were held, was very little west of the town of Pisa in .
Elis, and the names are sometimes confounded. It was at these gemes
that both the Ladae on record won their prizes. His success cost one

103. solet liis ·iouoscere.l “He is wont to pardcn such faults as

allowance for their own besetting sins, and think the Almighty does
so too. They think also they can get pardon whenever they please
tor asking, and so they put off the asking; and few think otherwise
than that their own day ol account is some way off. To make a lot
