SATIRE VIII.

Tan vice ol aristocratic pratension is here represented with mode
ration and good sense. There is no idle declamation against heredi-
tary honors; but the blindness of men belonging· to an exclusive class,
whose claime to distinction were founded upon the marite of the
grem and good of former generations and unsupportedby any personal
merite of their own, is shown in language to which no one can object
and reasoning which admits of no answer. The Satire is in the form
of aletter addressed to one Pontius. Heis one of the class against
whose degenerare members the Satire Is directed; and we may sup-
pose he was a young man with what we should call good prospecte.
The pride of birth and the degeneracy of inherited nobility were not
new features of society in Juvenal’s time, and they have not grown
so old in ours but that generations to come will complain-as he did,
and pour contempt, aa he did not, on the inheritance of noble names,
however virtuous their possessore maybe. There are some severe

lines on the Emperor Nero (211-230), and the Satira was written ·

after his time, as the context shows; but how long itis impossible to
say. Certain references to military moveruents and victories would
seem to place it a little later than ab. 100. · ’
Anconam-Of what use are pedigrees and ancestral blood, if in
the face of our great ancestors we live omiss? Virtus aloneis true
nobility (1-20). Names cannot change nature or make a man illustrious
[tl-38). Yon take credit to yourself for your dement, and place your·
self above the common herd. But ln that rabble you willfind eloquence
and bravery, while you are useless (an-55). The horse is called noble
which wine in the race3 if he cannot do this, he sells for little (to-70).
I would not have you valued on the merita of your family; it is apocr
thing to rest on another's fame. Do your duty, and value not your
life before your character (tl-86). When you get the charge of u
province, respect the rights of men and obey the laws. Those sub
jects suffered less when they were first subdued; peaceful govemors
have spoiledthem. But even they are careful not to touch those
whom they fear (at-124). lf you and your favorites and your wife
are just, you may trace your birth to any source you please. But,
otherwise, your ancestors only make your shame the greater (rut-145).
