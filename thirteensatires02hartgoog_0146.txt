194. sic labentibus oldut Villicns] ‘Sic' is used δεικτικῶς, and means
‘ln this crazy way! ‘ Villicus,' which properly signified the steward
of a farm, was applied to the superintendant ol any other works.
Here it means the agent ol the owner. ‘Labentibus’ means ‘the
falling inmates' or ‘the falling walls!

198. jamfrivola transfert] Juvenal calls the man Ucalegon, having
in mind Aeneas's description ol the burning of Troy (Aen. ii. 310).
‘dam'is only introduced to make the scene more present. ‘Poscit
aquam,' ‘eries Firel' ‘Tabulatum’ is that which is luid down with
boards, ‘tabulae’ and so is used for a story oi a house. Three stories
were found in· ledginghouses only; and the ‘tertia tabulata’ were the
‘coenacula' referred to above (verse lea, n). For ⁴ tibi,' see A. tl, 7,
d; Η. 389; B. 838. ‘Trepidara’ which means running to and fro,
contains the root ‘trep' ulrich appears in τρέπω.

cula was probably a wel-known dwarf. For the case, see Μ. 308,
obs. I. ‘Marmore’ refers to the ‘abacus' The use oi ‘nec non'
simply for ‘et' islater than Cicero. Hc uses the phrase only when
‘non' is closely joined with some other word in the sentence.

206. Jamque vaus Graecos] lle had some old Greek volumes in au
old chest, which the mice were gnawing. The Opici, as the Greeks
called them, or Osci, as the Romans, were among the earliest inhabi-
tants of Italy, from whom appear tohave been descended the Latini
and other nations on the west coast of Italy to the southern extremity
of Campania, the Sabellian raees oi central Italy, and the Apulians
and others on the eastern coast. Their name here is taken as synony-
mous with ‘barbari' which would be natural, as the only trace of that
people to be found in Juvenal's time was in their language‚ as it
apppared ln the Atellane plays, which were unintelligible to the mul-
titu e. '

tors named Polycletus, of whom themora famous is conjectured to
have been a native ol Sicyon, and afterwards a citizen of Argos. He
lived during the Peloponnesian war, and Euphranor at Athens about
a {eIlGerIdlleEsianmsm] The MSS. vary here, and the verse seems
