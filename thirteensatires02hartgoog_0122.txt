aad since paper must be spoilt, mercy would be tlrrown away : 1 may
as well spoil it as others.'' Schoolboys will not want to be told what
‘manum semdae subducers' means; but it appears the commentatore
are not agree.

and died next year in retirement. ‘Suasoriae' were distinguished
from ‘coutroversiae' and belonged rather to boys' schools. On tlte

20. Auruncae flexit ulamma] Suessa, in Campania, the later capital
of the Aurunci, whose original town Aurunca (five miles from Suessa) “ ’
was destroyed by the Sidicini, was called Suessa Aurunca. It was ¹
the birth-place of Lucilius. ‘Placidi'is the nominative plural. ,w ·· '

22. Maeuio Tuscum Figat aprum] This refers to the ‘venationem' or

' flghts with wild beasts at the circus and amphitheatres. The heasts m<- · ¹
fought with each other, or with men trained ior the purpose and
called ‘bestiarii' Of these many were free uren and volunteers
fighting for pay, and among them were sometimes found women,
even those of equestrian aud senatorial familias, a thing which seems ⁴
to have happened first in the year aar. 63, in the reign oi Nero.
Domitian forced into the arena not only rnen of rank, but rvornen also.
The practice was put down more· than a century later by a senatus· ιν,
consultum, no. mo, in the reign of Sept. Severus. The boars of '
Etruria were particularly large. . The women are said to hunt with
their breasts bare like the Amazone.

25. Quo tondente] There was a barber, Licinus, mentioned by
Horace, oi whom the Scholiast says that he was made a senator by
C. Julius Caesar. There appears to have been some such story con-
nected with a low man of this name, for it passed into a proverb.

ΜΘ. omna Canopi Crispinus] Canopus, or Canobus, which gave its
name to one oi the branchos oi the Nile, was about fifteen miles from
Alexandria, aad a town oi dissolute nrorals, as seaports ore wont to
be. It is ior this reason that Juvenal makes his upstart Crispinus a
native of Canopus. How he commended himself to Domitian, and
rose to bc an eques, aloes uot appear. ‘Verna' was a slave born in
his master's house: this man was therefore a ‘libertinus'

27. Durius humero reuocante lucernas] The ‘lacerna' was a loose
cloak worn over the ‘toga' It was usually oi costly dye and ma· ·
terial, being worn chiefly by the rich. The words describe the way
in which the cloak was worn, hiiehed up on the left shoulder hy a
brooch or something of that sort, and flooring in the windlso that the
shoulder seems to pull it backs This man appears to have had light
rings sor summer, and heavi'er ior winter. That he wore a gold ring
does not prove that he was an eques, ior by the emperors aiter Tiberius
the privilege was given to the lowest oi the people. b “ ,
