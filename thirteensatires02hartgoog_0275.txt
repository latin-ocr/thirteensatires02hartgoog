SATIRE XVI.

Ir seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that this isan unfinished
poem, and it. may well have been a posthumous publication. lt has
been doubted whether Juvenal ever wrote it; but no imitator who
' evidently could do well, would have been willing to leave the poem in
the condition in which we llud it. There does not seem to be suffl-
cient reason for supposing the fragment to be spurious or for thinking
that the partial reJ'ection of it in early times proceeded from any other
cause than its imperfect character. It is in the form of an epistle, and
professes to set forth the advantages of military service, looking at it
as ayoung man might when tired of the restraints of a civilian's

e.

Aaouuanr. -0 Gallus, who can tell the advantages of lucky ser-
vicet First, no civilian dares assault you; and, if you beat him, he
dares not bring you before the praetor. He must refer his case to the
centurion; and his revenge will beharder for him than the wrong; wit-
nesses will not dare to testify on his side (1-34). Ii a civilian has a
trouble with his neighbor, he has to walt for all the delays of the law;
the soldier gets justice done him at once (db-50). Again, all that the
soldier eams is ,his own3 his father has no control over it. The fatlrer
will court the successful son. For itis for the general's interest that
the breve should be lucky and rewarded (sl-60).

vantages of military service if it be successfult As for that, if l can

Samos is-well known. Her temple, the Heraeum, was on the coast,
and it is to the Samian shore that ‘arena’ refers.
