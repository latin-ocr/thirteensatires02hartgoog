30. qui nigrum in candidu venunt] ‘Who will suear blaclr is white,'
which was a proverbial way of speaking with the Romans aa with us.

Governmentcontracts have in all times been profitable affairs. Juve-
nal speaks of men contracting for the repair of temples and shrines,
as well as for clearing the beda of rivers, cleansing and keeping the
severs, the repairing os harbors, and likewise for funerals, and for the
sale of slaves by auction. Public works, which under the republic
were looked after by the aediles, had special officers (curatores) to
superintend them during the empire, aud the functione and dignity of
the aediles were much curtailed. These officers engaged contractors
(redemptores) to carry out the necessary worlrs. The clearing of tha
Tiber was particularly necessary from the quantity oi alluvial soil
brought down by the stream and the rapidity with which weeds
formed in the bed. The Cloaca Maxima, said to have been constructcd
by Tarquinius Priscus, was large enough forabunt or a waggon of
hay to pass down it. The underground works of Rome were on
nearly as large ascale in proportion as those of Londou. Tlre cost of·
keeping these drains in repair was very large3 though the solid cou-
struction of the Cloaca Maxima with stone arches, ol which remains
still exist, letl little to be done for that. On occasions when a pub·
lic funeral (‘ funus indictivum' or ‘censorium 'J was decreed, such as
Tacitus osten mentions, it was performed through a ‘redemptor,'
whose duty it would be to provide mournem (men and women), mn-

sicians, ‘lectica' and hearers, funeral pile, and every thing connected -

with the procession, hurning, and burial of the body, on such a scale
aa the senate might determine. ‘Busta' were places adjoining sep
nlchres, where the bodies were burnt.

A sale by auction on the public account was conducted by a
‘praeco' in the presence of a public officer, and a spear was set up
on the spot where the auction took place. It may have been called
‘domina' in this place because the sale transferred to the purchases
‘dominium' or ownership, in the thing purchased. The spem is said
to have been derived from the practice followed in old times in the
selling os prisoners and booty on the field of battle. ‘Praebere' is
hercle ‘to put up to auction' The word ‘ venalia’ belonged especially
to saves.

34. Quondam lvi cunicines] These men started from the lowest be-

were well known. “Now they gi've shows of 1gladiatura themselves:
and put men to death to please the people‚'' who, when a gladiator
had his adversary down, gave the signal for his despatch or to spare
him, by turning their thumbs up or down. The number ol victims
at these shows was enormous, and they were never more frequent
than in the reign of Domitian. The expense lavished on them was
likewise beyond belief.
