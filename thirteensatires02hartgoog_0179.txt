Athens about the middle of the fifth century sao. He taught rhetoric
in particular, and had a high reputation. llis end, which Juvenal
allodes to, is not known on any other authority than that of the

eloquent. Juvenal says he called Cicero an Allobrox, in other words,
abarbarian. He meant probably in comparison with himself ; hut his
pupils beat him notwithstanding. The Allobroges were a Gallio tribe

on the left bank of the Rhone. The construction of ‘quemque'is ἵ

easily explained, as a sort of synesis or partitive apposition.
