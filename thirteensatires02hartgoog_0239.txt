18⁷. Plurima stalis] He says, “Philosophy is the areana 01 happi-
ness, 0011 by degrees divests 0001 1110 greater part 01 001010111010010 ,
and all our 11111110 01 judgment3 ’1100 0110 first taught us right from
wrong, 101 certainly it’s only dwarfed, infirm, and little minds that love
revenge; which you may gether straight 11001 11110, 11101 00 000 likes it
better than a woman.” ‘ hlinutus ’ is a participle, and had better here
be rendered 00 00011. ‘Vitia' are faults 01 001010, 00100 01 which
cannot be eradicated. ‘Errores' correspond to ‘ culpas,’ and are 1011110
01 practice. As to ‘Sapientia' see 00 verse 20.

192. Uar 1011011] These lines are very vigorous. He begins to
illustrate what 110 said in the first 1001 lines. ‘Attonitos ' 10 used as
in xii. 21. 00 ‘surdo’ see note on vii. 11. Who Caedicius was it is
impossible to say. The ‘Scholiast tells us he was a courtier and most
fruel satellite 01 Nero. Rhadamanthus was one 01 thejud-ges iu the
01101 world.

199. Spartano crt'dam respondit] This story is put by Herodotus
into the mouth 01 Leotychides, the Spartan, in an address to the
Atheniens. He warns them against breaking their saith by relating
1110101001 000 Glaucus who bore the highest reputation for honesty
10011 Sparta. A 010001 Miletus came to 1111110011 0011111101, in 000-
sequence of his reputation 101 just dealing, he wished 10 deposit halt
his fortune with him. Glaucus accepted the deposit, and promised to Δ
restore the money to any one who should produce certain tokens 01111
010101 it. This the ntan's sons afterwards did; but Glaucus prol'essed
10 have torgotten all about the matter, and required tour months to
10110011 1110 memory. This time he employed in consulting the oracle
at Delphi as to whether he might not keep the money and swear he
had never received it. The answer 0111100100Ιο was conveyed in
seven lrexameters denouncing dreadful punishment ou the brenker of
oaths; and Glaucus, begging pardon oi'the god, pald the money. The
priestess did not let him go without a wholesome warning, saying, τὸ
πειρηθῆναι τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὸ ποιῆσαι 10011 δύνασθαι, 110 who tempta God is as
bad as he who does the wickedness which it is in his mind to do.
Leotychides winda up his story by saying that Glaucus had not one
(10000000011011,11011001111910 house was extinct3 and his moral 10
111010 good man has 00 011101 thought about 0 deposit than to return
11 when it is called for.

200. quod dubitaret Depositum retinere] We should say ‘dubitavit
reddere,' he hesitated about restoring. But 110 also hesitated about
keeping the money, and that was his offense.

209. 117011100οἰ10 intra 00 tacitam] It has been thought that Juvenal
could not have got this sentiment without the light 01 Christianity, in
the 100101 teaching 01 which no doubt it is alandamental rule. But the
ethics oi Christianity 010 110 new invention. They do but 0010100
1110 teaching 01 conscience, which has only to be 1100 and it will tell· a
man, without further revelation, that evil desires are sin, especially 111
1110 case that Juvenal supposes, where cowardice, not principle (mori-
bus, verse 204), preventa the accomplishment oi them. The Roman
· law adopted the principle 01 punishing for the intention 10 commit a
011010, just the same as 111110 011010 11010001010111011. But 00 a man's
