saurus xiv. 229

107. Sponte tamea juvenes] But though young men are only too
prone to imitate, yet there is one vice of which this cannot be said;
to avarice they are not only not prone, but eren averse (¹ inviti quo·
que’i. This is true generally, but not universaily. ‘Quoque’ is
equivalent to ‘etiarn’ or ‘vel;' the usage has been noticed above.

‘Fallit enim’ is elliptica13 they are bid and they do as they are bid, ·

for they are deceived by the appearance of virtue, though it is but the
shadow, which this vice wears. ‘Habitu' is the general appearance,
and applies equally to ‘vultu' and ‘ veste! ‘Frugi' is always used in
a good sense for ‘prudent’ or ‘thrifty' ‘Tutela' is used for ‘tutor'
by a common ligure of speech-“ metonomy.”

ns Hesperidum serpeus aut Pauticuall 'Phe Hesperides watched the

Χ ’ apples and the serpent Ladon watchedt ellesperides Hercules killed

him, The golden fleece oi Colchis in Pontus was also guarded by a
serpent, but Medea put him to sleep ,and Jason took the fleece. ibe
miser watching his treasures is said to watch better than this. As to

huuc ule Quo loqrror] Juvenal supposes arespectable-looking person
of this sort, such as the father might point out to bis son as an instance .
of the beneflts of thriltiness.

115. pratas ucquireudi] Public opinion treats the man as a workmau
diligent iu his calling, which is to make money, and this he gets any
mh he can, plying the auvil and working the forge hom morning till
ni t.

319. Et puter erpo] “The father too, as 1 said; ” another instance
oi ‘ergo' in this sense (see x. 54, n). The young are taken in hy the
reputation the miser geta, and they are also influenced by their fathers’
exffglegrltlidmffiffipes,i He is not speaking of all fathers, sor some '
are extravagant, but of the money-loving father. And so he says the
father thinks the covetous happy, that is, he who admires wealth and
thinks there never was an instance oi a man who uasat once poor
and lavored by heaven; such a man advises his sons to go that road und
adhere to that sect (as if they were the only philosophare). ‘Felices’
are happy men; ‘beati' are those who prosper or are favored by the
gods. ‘Pauper’ is not used lor an indigent person, but lor one of small '
means, and sach may prosper; but this father thinks not, because the
more a man has the more hc gets. Ι ,

elementa as every science has, and in teaching their children this viee
oi covetousness fathers begin with petty acts of meanness, and after-
wards teaoh it thern on the largest scale.

126. Servorum ventres] lle here gives a description of ararica, such
as these fathers would fumish examples of, and the lonn of the satire
changes. He is speaking oi the domestic arrangements of the miser,
in which he punishes himsell not less thau his wretched slaves. He
gerasan out their allowance ol corn in a false measure, while he stara-es

unse .
