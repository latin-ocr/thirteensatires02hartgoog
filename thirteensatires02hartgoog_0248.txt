sannen xnv. 229

10⁷. Sponte tumen juvenes] But though young men ane only too
prone to imitate, yet there is oue vice of which this cannot be said;
to avariae they are not only not prone, but even averse (‘ inriti quo·
que'). This is true generally, but uot universally. ‘Quoque’ is
equivalent ιο ‘etiarn’ or ‘vel;' the usage has been noticed above.

‘Fallit enim' is elliptical; they are hid and they do as they are bid, ·

ior they are deceived by the appearance oi virtue, though it is hut the
shadow, which this vice wears. ‘Habitu' is the general appearance,
and applies equally to ‘vultu’ and ⁸ veste.' ‘Frugi' is always used in
a good sense for ‘prudent' ur ‘thrifty' ‘Tutela' is used ior ‘tutor’
by a common tigrane of speech-“ metonomy.'’

ue Hesperidum serpens aut Pennana& The Hesperides watched the

Ι apples and the serpent Ladon neuneu t e Hesperides Hercules killed

him. The golden fleece oi Colchis in Pontus was also guarded by a
serpent, but Medea put him tu deep and Jason took the fleece. The
miser watching his treasures is said ιο watch better than this. As tu
the Hesperides, see above, v. 152, n.

hanc de Quo loquor] Juvenal supposes nrespectnble-iooking person
oi this sort, such as the father might point out ιο his son as an instance .
uf the beueilts of thrittiness.

115. pietat aepisirendn] Publio opinion treats the man as aworkmau
diligent iu his calling, which is to make money, and this he gete any
wapl he cau, plying the auvil aud working the lorge from morning till
ni ι.

119. Ει pater ergo] “The father too, as 1 said; ”another instance
ot ’ergo' iu this sense (see x. 54, n). The young are taken in by the
reputation the miser gets, and they are also influenced by their fathers’
expppieqaplfimppggeppffl He is not speaking oi all fathers, ior some '
are extravagant, but of the money-leving father. And so he says the
father thinks the covetous happy, that is, he who admires wealth aud
thinks there never was an instance oi a man who was at once poor
andiavored by heaveu3 such aman advises his sons to go thatroad and
adhene to that sect (as if they were the only philosophers). ‘Felices'
are happy men; ‘beati' are those who prosper or are savored by the
gods. ‘Pauper' isnot used ior an indigent person,but for one oi small '
means, aud such may prosper; but this father thinks not, because the
more a man has the more hc geta. ,

123. Sunt qttuedam vitiorum elementass He says all vices have their ’
elementa as every sciense has, and in teaching their children this vice
oi conetousness fathers begin with petty acts of meanness, aud after·
warde teach it them ou the largest scale.

126. Servorum ventres] He liene gives a description oi aramue, such

as these fathers would furnish examples os, and the surm of the satire

changes. He is speaking of the domestic arrangemeuts oi the miser,

in which he punishes himself not less thau his wretched slaves. He

lslei-sresuout their allowauoe oi corn in a false measme, while he starves
rmse .

12⁴7. nequas esim omnia ιιιειίνιοι] ‘Neque’ is ‘not eren! ‘sustinere'
