56 Unde tibifiontem] 'l'he verb tobe supplied is ‘paras' or‘parabis.'
The ellipsis is like that with ‘quo' in verse 135. See references on
viii. u. ‘Frontem' is here the commandiug brow of one in authority.
Iu xi. 204, ‘⁴ salva fronte '' means ‘ without shame!

⁵⁷. nocuumque cerebro] This means that the man is mad and wants
cupping. ‘Cucurbita’ is a cuppingglass, so called from its having
the shape of a gourd, which is the first meaning of the word. The
‘cucurbita' is called ‘ventosa' from ignorance of the principle on
which it acts, as the word ‘ventosa' was used alone fora cupping-
glass iu mediaeval Latin. A partial vacuum is created in the cup,
which being so applied to any part of the body removes the pressure
of the uir from that spot and causes a rush of blood to it. The ancients
used both dry cupping and bleeding aa we do for affections os tha
head in particular. 'rue cup was usually of bronze or of horn. ‘Caput
hoc' is dramate, as if he put his finger on the man’s sorehead.

⁵9. Hospite venturo] lle goes on to say that a great fuss is mado
when company is coming, to get the house in order and to make a
show with the plate, furniture, and marble. The mester rushes about
like a madman with asticis in his hand, calling to the slaves to do their
work. But is it not of more consequence, he aske, that your son
should see your home free from vite and spotless, than that your
friend should see your furniture in that conditioni The picture is
well drawn and the moral well applied. ‘Vasa aspera ' are opposed

argentum. ‘Arida’ may appl y to the spider in tho sense of leau and
withered‚ or to the web, for which it is a iit epithet, as ‘dry.'

66. Nec persico luto] He would not have the ‘ atrium,' which was
the first room the guests would enter, show that dogs bad been there,
nor have him see the ‘porticus' even splashed with rain. This was
outside the house. Perhaps, however, he means the ‘peristylium 'or
else the galleries on each side of the ‘impluvium' In any case it
was open to the westher. The plural ‘atria is commonly used by the
poeta for the convenience of their verse ; but as the room had two

wings (alae) opening upon it, and the whole formed one apartment, ,

the plural is not without meaning. This being the most public room
in the house and open to the sky, dogs may have had greater license
there than in other rooms. ,

uno Semodio scobis] With half a modius of sawdust, which the
Romans commonly used for cleaning the floors, especially after dinner
when the scraps were cleared away; usually it was scented. The
‘semodius' was very nearly a gallon of our measure. ‘Unus' twice
repeated, ‘semodio,' and ‘servulus' are all emphatic, to mark the
tridiug character of the job and the folly of the master’s excitement
‘Omnis' is rarely used for ‘ullus' See M. 494, note l (p. 460).

70. patriae civem populoque dedisti] “ You have given your country
(and a welcome gift it is) a good citizen, if you have made hirn (your
