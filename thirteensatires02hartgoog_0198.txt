enormous wealth, which he offered to the emperor as a gift at a time
when he knew that his enemies were suecesstuny conspiring against
him. Within four years ol Nero's accession he was said ιο have
amassed 300‚000 sestertia, which is nearly t12,000,000. He was re·
turning from Campania, and had sto ped at hia villa four miles from
Rome, when a tribune was seut by kero to obtain his answer to the
charge on which his life depended. The tribune entered while Seneca
was at dinner with his wife and two friends, having first placed a
guard round the house, which Juvenal here refers to. Plautius Late·
ranna, like Seneca, was put to death asa party to Piso’s conspiracy
against Nero. lla was consul designatus. The change oi tense in
‘obsidet' seems to be sor metrical reasons aloue. Juvenal applies to
all three what is strictly true of Seneca alone.
19. argenti vascua part] ‘Argentum purum'is silver without any
figures or chasing.
2³. Primasere aare] “The first and most familiar prayers.'’ ‘Opes '

The ⁶ argentarii' carried on their business in the forum. Tlrose who
had considerable deposita with them, it appears, had each his own

the sages one,’·' etc. The laugher was Democritus oi Abdera; the
weeper, Heracleitus. The tormer flourished at the beginning ot the
fifth century s.c.; the latter a little earlier, at Ephesus. The enclitio
‘ne’ seems to be used in the sense of ‘nonna’ though the granimars
(11346, 11., 1, 1; Μ. 451, α; Z. 352) allow it only the meaning oi
‘num ' when added to any other word than the verb. See verse 90,
wfhere it isjoined to the verb, aad certainly seems to have the force
o ‘num' . ,

31. Sed facilis crisis rigidi] He says any one can laugh; the only
wonder is where the weeper got all his tears. ‘Rigidi cachinni'is a
hard sardonia laugh; the genitive is appositiones: See iri. 4, n.

only on triumpha?> occasions; it was kept in the Capitol, and had its
name from this. It was also called ‘tunica palmata, either because it
was embroidered with lm branches, or because it had a stripe
