cording to Plutarch, the priests abstained from fish of every kind.
Snrall mumrny fish have been found in tombs, according to the
Arabian traveller (of the 12th century) Abdallatif, who also found
skeletons of dogs, which Herodotus says were buried in sacred tombs
in the various cities of Egypt. Dog mummies have been found, and

himself on a raft which she taught him to build, he was carried to the
island Scheria, inhabited by the Phaeacians, whose king was Alcinous.
