tors agreed that, aiter the tyrant was killed, Piso should also be put
out oi the way, and the empire offered to Seneca, who had been tutor
t‘o Nero, but had fallen under his suspicion. The conspiracy was

his father’s murder. He did not murder his sister Electra, nor his
wilfc Hermione (daughter oi' Menelaus and Helen), nor poison his
reations.
