PREFAOE ΤΟ AMERIOAN EDITION.

MY purpose iu preparing this edition oi the Satires
of Juvenal has been to make Mr. MAcLEANu's
notes accessible to American undergraduates. The
text is that of Mr. Lous's revision of ΜΓ. Macleane’s ·
work, without alteration, except that three Satires
areomitted. The greater part of the notes consiste
of an abridgment oi those which are contained in
the¹ same work, the matter omitted being chiefly
,quotations from other classical authors and discus·
sions as to readings and interpretatione* In making
this abridgment‚ the arrangement of sentences has
been sometimes altered,; and material has been
· freer incmporated into the notes from the new
edition of Mr. MAYou's commentary (extending
now to the end oi the seventh Same), from that cf

’ Hammon, and iromcther sources. Notes on oon-

struotion have also been inserted3 and, wherever
they seemed necessary or desirable‚ references have
been given to several oi the Grammars in most com· ’
