how small a portion oi our dregs are from Greeeet’ ‘ Quota' with
‘pars' (or here ‘porti0') generally signifies ‘how small a part! ‘Quo-
tus' is the question which is answered by an ordinal numeral (M. vt,
obs. 2; A. ti S. 119, m), and ‘quota pars' means properly, in a series
oi graduated parts what place would the thing occupr and the im·
plication is that it would come very late in the series. ‘Whath part'
(if we had such a word) would express ‘quota pars,' as ‘septima pars,'
‘octava’ etc, would be the seventh, eighth, etc, part.

62 in Tiberim defluxit Orontes] The Orontes is here put generally
for the province oi Syria, which was added to the Roman dominions
by Cn. Pompeius, rac. bb. Its own trade, and that of the East, to
which it opened a wider door, brought to Rome that influx os slaves
ot' which Juvenal complains. The Orientale have little or no ear for
music; and on lower ground than Umbricius takes, he might have
run away from the music oi Bastern fiagcolets, harpe, and drums.
They were probably such as are still in use all ove‘r Asia, and nodis·

The first instrument has usually but two or three holes, and no stops,

The Circus Maximus had vauits under it, which were occupied by
prostitutes. ‘iussas' means that they were hired lor the purpose by
others, who made gain oi their prostitution. ¹For the construction,

66. picta luipo barbaro mitrai] ‘Pictos’ like ποικίλος, means ‘em-
broidered.' he women in Eastern Asia do not wear any thing on
their head but a veil to draw over their face. The ‘mitra' a sort oi
light turben, belonged to the women of Syria and Asia Minor. The
effeminate Romans took to wearing it. It is always associated with
them or with harlots. Why these persons should he called by a name ·
which means a shewolf is obvious. According to Livy, the story of
Romulus and Remus being nursed by a well is founded on their hav·

6⁷. Rusticus ille tuus] lle apostrophizes Romulus. of ‘ trechedipna'
the Scholiast says they were Greek shoes (caligulae) worn by pare·
sites running to dinner. The derivation from τρέχειν and δεῖπνον is
obvious enough 3 and whatever the things vvere, the context shows
they were Greek. That they were shoes may be inferred from the
name. ‘Rusticus’ does not here mean a rustic literally, but the de·
scendunts of rustice.

68. Et ceromatico sert ηἰοοίοήο collo] ‘Ceroma' (κὴρομο) was a prep

ancinted. ‘Niceteria' (viamptrff here means the prizes oi victory for
wrestling, a practice introduce at Rome under the emplre. The
early Romans despised the Greek gymnastic exercises, and Nero was
the first to build a public gymnasium or training-school ior wrestlers,
etc. Juvenal mentions this as one of the discreditable Greek innova·
tione. Hennes Greek words designedly.
