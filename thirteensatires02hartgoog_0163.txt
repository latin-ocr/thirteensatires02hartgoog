³8. Heliadum acsias] Ovid relatas how the three daughters of the
Suu, Phaethusa, Lampetie, and Phoebe, wept for their brother Phae-
ton on the beaks of the Eridanus, and were turned into poplars from
which tears carne forth and were hardened hythe sun into amber,
‘succinum’ or ‘electrum' ‘Crustae’ were probably platos of thin
metat, as the name implies, as distinguished from ‘emblemata’ or
figures laid on tlte vessel.

r'aacqaales beryllo} The beryl is a species of emerald. ‘Inaequales' ·
means ‘embossed ‘Phiala' was the Greek name corresponding to
the Latin ‘patera’ abrosa, flat cup for drinking or libation. Our word
‘viai' is derived from it. Virro is the great inan.

42. iaspis] ‚Iasper is a species cf quartz varying through all colors,
and opaque. ‘Da veniam,' “ you may excuse the master for watching
his cnps, ior they have rare gems on them.'' The words ‘da veniam
- iaspis,' may be those of the servant to the guest, ‘⁴ Excuse nie, bnt
that cup has a fine stone on it,'' giving him a hint, as a saucy sellow
mi ln.

Vatinius, rose by low means to high favor with Ner0; and it appears

that his name for some reason was given to a particular kind of cup ¹
(nasitema), perhaps from its having one or more nozzles equal in
length to hia nose, which Mortial says was a long one. ‘Nasorum ,

quatuor ' is a genitive of quality.

62. Digna supercilia] They justify his pride, called ‘supercrhum'
from the motion of the eyebrow by which it is expressed.

from ‘nam' and both mean ‘certainly,’ ‘of course,’ ‘you know,’ but
with a causei sense included. On the mode of ‘ poscas,' see references
on iii. 3, ‘destinet’ and add M. 397.

was an extravagant number t'or one house. Soon afterwards much
larger numbers were kept.
