suumn xvr. 249

7. communia] Thai which all soldiers held in common· ‘Togatus'
is the common word ior a civilian, ‘Immo' here is affirmative of
what precedes, and introduces something more. It is sometimes used
negatively according to the nature ot the sentence; but its common
use is to add some statement, reason, etc, in continuation and support
of what goes before. ‘Ne' (from which ‘ut' must be supplied before
‘dissimulet' M. 462, b) seemsused to introduce an appositionsl clause. .
If so, it must be used for ‘ut non) Compare M. 374; Α. 70, 4,s; Z.
623. It may be explained in another way, as depending on an idea of
hindering to he supplied.

11. tumidis livoribas uffan] ‘Offa,' which is used for a chop or other
piece of meat, here means a ewelling from a blow. ‘Livoribus' are
black contusione. ‘Medico nil promittente' means that the doctor
cannot warrant that the man will not lose his eye.

13. Bardaicus judea datur] ‘Judex’ is predicate. It is not certain
that ‘bardaicus' agrees, as many take it, with ‘calceus ' in this place.
1 think it may be taken independently. ‘Calceus' will in that case be
qualified like ‘surae' by ‘grandes' ‘ Calceus' was the general name
fora walking shoe or boot ss opposed to others worn in the house, or
sandals which only covered the sole or were strapped on to the upper
partos the toot. Oi the latter sort were ‘caligae' (verse 24) which
were heavy sandals with nails worn by the common soldiers as the

‘calceus' was worn hythe officere, though sometimes the officers wore .

‘caligae’ See iii. 321, n. The name ‘bardaicus' is said to be derived

from the Bardaei, an Illyrian peofle from whom this sort of military

ehoe was taken. Juvenal says according to the above) iia man
wishes to punish the soldier who has maltreated him, the judex as·

, signed to him is a} bardaicus,' a great boot, and a pair of thick calves

under a big bench ; that is, he must osny his csse into the canip, and
it he is allowed a trial it will be a court-martial with'a centurion for
judex. ‘iudicem dare' was properly said of the praetor, who could
appoint if he pleased a judex privatus to hear a private csse at the in-
stance oi the plaintiff. It is usual to describe the centurione as stout
men. J uvenal speaks here of great benches to match the great legs.
Ali isin the rough way.

1⁵. moro Camilli] The days of the old discipline when M. Furius
Camillus was dictator and besieged Veii (mc. 393).

17. Justissima Certationem Juvenal says that the centurione give
just judgment against a soldier, and ii a man goes before thern with
a good complaint he will get satisfaction. But he will find the whole¹
camp set against him, and his satisfaction will he worse for him than
his wrong. ‘Igitur' serves to keep the sentences together: ‘Well
then the centurion will give just judgment! . When he says ‘nec mihi
deerit,' he puts himself in the position of an injured civilian, as below,
verse 28, “non sollicitemus amicos.'' ‘Deerit must be read m two
syllables. ‘Querelae' is the genitive of quality, ‘a cause in which the
complaint is just! ‘Deferre,' with or without ‘nomem’ means to in·
form against. ‘Deferrecausam’isnotalegalghrase. ‘Tota cohors’ '
is put generally for ‘tota castra' (verse 2). ‘ onsensu magno' is an
ordinary phrase ior perfect unanimity.
