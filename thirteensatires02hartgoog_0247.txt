by others to belong to the reign of Hadrian, that is not far from the
time when this satire was written. The cathedral of Tivoli is built on
the foundatious of the temple of Hercules, who was worshipped above
other gods at Tibur. The enormous buildings erected by Hadrian at
the foot of the hills of Tibur could hardly have been built when Juve
nal wrote these verses, or they would probably have been referred to,
t'or in magnificence they surpassed any thing in Italy. Their ruins are
the admiration of travellers. -

91. Ut epodo ur'ueehrt] Posides was a ireedman of Claudius the
emperor, favored and afterwards suspected by him. Where he built
his magnificent house does not appear. It may have been near his
baths at Baiae. ‘Capitolia nostra ' is here opposed to the temples at
Praeneste and Tibur; but large temples of ‚tupiter in other towns,
besides the great temple in Rome, were sometimes called Capitolium.
The plural is used (us in x. ao) because of the tripartite character of
the building (xii. 3, 11).

93. l'rapit opes] This is the common verb ia this case. We use the
same *alren we spealr of breaking.

94. turiuroit filius amena] See vii. 129, “ Sic Pedo conturbat.'' The
use oi ‘dum ' with the present followed by a verb in the perfect tense,
which here occurs twice over, is common. See A. 58, 2, e ; Η. 467, 4 ;
and compare i. 09, and elsewhere.

ι 96. tltefttettiem subbato parreia] He goes on to say that some men
whose fathers were superstitious and paid respect to the Jewish re
ligion go further und turn Jews. ‘Metus' ‘metuo' are ordinarily used
for religione fear (verse 101). From the courts of the temple being
uncovered the Jews were supposed by the vulgar to worship the skies.

98. Nec dr'stare patant] Thetis, they abstain from hog's flesh as they
would from man’s. The quadrupeda forbidden to the Israeliten ior
ftfiod were all which did aot chew the eud and were not clovenfooted
i evit. xi).

102. Tradidit arcano This is merely ratidom talk. There was
nothing analogous in t s hooks of Moses to the ‘arcana’ of the
Roman worship, though they were looked upon as unintelligible and
were therefore supposed to have a mysterious meaning revealed iotha
initiated onl . ι

103. Nonymonstrare aias] He says the law of Moses teaches Jews
not to show any one the way except he be sJew, nor to tell the tired
traveller where he may quench his thirst. The Romans might be for-
given for this interpretation of the law of Moses when the Jews' own
traditione and teachers told them they must love their neighbor and
hate their enemy (see St. Matt. v. 4353 and Jew and Samariten
thought it strange that our Saviour asked for water from a Samariten
woman and talked with her. The old law was not of thi tenor. “If
thine enemy be hungry give him breed to eat. and if he be thirsty
give him walerio drink,'' is Solomon’s interpretation of the law
(Prov. xxv. 21); and the parable of the good Samariten succoring a
Jew was used to illustrate the fundamental rule, ‘⁴ Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.’' See besides lix. xxiii. 4, ii. ‘Monstrare’ aad
‘deducere’ are in a kind of appositior with ¹ jus!
