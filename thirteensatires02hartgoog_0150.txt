him where he posta himself to beg, in what ‘proseucha ’ he must look .
for himii he wants to find him. A ‘proseucha' was an oratory, a
building erected for the use ot those towns where there was no syna-
gogue, outside the walls hy a stream or the sea-side, lor the benedt ol
ablution. It was used like the synagogae for reading the law and prayer
three times a day. In the Acts of the Apostles (xvi. 13) the writer says

οὐ ἐνομίζετο προσευχὴ εἶναι, and there προσευχὴ rs generally understood
to be a building ol this sort. Iu the Gospel by St. Lake (vi. 12) our
Saviour is said to have passed the night lv τῇ προσευχῇ τοῦ θεοῦ, where
also Whitby and other commentatore take προσευχὴ tor a house ot'
prayer. As to the use ol the present in ‘quaero,' Madvig says in his
‘Opusculaz' “The Latius almost always use the present indicative

the foreat ol Gallinaria were infested by banditti. Augustus took
grem ains to put them down, and so did Tiberius; and itwould seem
from luvenal's words that their plan of having military posts in the
different places the robbers frequented was still pursued. Drivcn out
from the above haunts, they took up their abode in the city, where they
carried on their trade (which is the meaning of ‘agit rem '), breaking
into houses and murdering the inhabitants. ⁴ Subitus ’ seems to mean
