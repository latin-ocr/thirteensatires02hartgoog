dangerous voyage, and ismore of the nature of a familiar
m letter than of a Satire. The dishonesty of the age isde-
ι scribed in the thirteenth Satire, which contains some of
J uvenal's finest verses, and shows him in the best char-
acter. This also is in the formos an epistle to a friend,
XI and ‚⁸⁰⁴ is the eleventh‚ which contains an invitation to
dinner and contrasts the poet’s own plainness of living
· with the luxurious habits of his contemporaries. Thus
Juvenal goes through all the great scandale of his day,
η and treats them unsparingly. The crimes and criminals
of former teigne are freely introduced by way of illustra-
tion, but this is because the vices of one reign represented
those of another, and the names of the dead could be
more safely used than of the living. Tiberius, Caligula,
. Claudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all brought up from
time to time to points moral or illustrate sorne aspect of

cume.

Themost celebrated of J uvenal’s poems, the tenth, has
more of the declamatory character, which some of his
critica attribute to all. Itis on the vanity of human
wishes, which is illustrated chiefly by historical exemplos,
and the poem has not much bearing upon the particular
characteres his times. It is the finest specimen of that
sort of composition that 1 am acquainted with. The
fisteenth Satire is connected with a scene of little general
interest, an Egyptian squabble, J uvenal’s own interest in
which can only be accounted for hy his having been in the
country where it happened. The last Satire, isit had been ,,,
completed, would have furnished a sketch of military life,
sarcastic but good-humored, from which a good deal of
information might have been derived.
