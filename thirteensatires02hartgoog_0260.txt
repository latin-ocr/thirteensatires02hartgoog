sarran x1v. 233

212. nicheam. praesto empirica] ‘Praesto ’ is Ἰ warrant,' and ‘lore' ‘

may be supplied aiter ‘ meliorem! He says to the iathar he need not
be iu a hurry3 he may go away and make himaeil easy ; bissenis
certain toturn out a good scholar and surpass his teacher as i'ar as
Ajax surpassed his father Telamon, and Achilles l'eleus. lle adds
sarcasmorum, “ you must not press the young mind; his marronis not
yet thoroughly saturated with the atrocities oi matured vice ς when hc
comes to rnan’s estate he will be ripe ior all that is wicked.'' The ex-
pression ‘nondum implevere medullas’ is something like that in the
book ol Job (xx. 11) : “ His bones are iull ol the sin oi his youth.'’

220. araca jain creda aarum] “ You may consider your daughter·
iri-law as good as dead and buried il she brings your son a large por-
tion.'' Except under special agreement before marriage the wrl‘e's
‘dos' went back to her relations at her death. llere theman must
secure an interest in the proferty at his wiie’s death, or it would be
against his interest to mur er her. Notice the plural in ‘vestra'
‘Quibus digitisl' is expressive: ‘with what flngersl' We can
almost see the man clutching his wiie’s throat.

225. Mandaot'‚] ‘Mandare’ is used here like ‘ tradere’iorteaching
(see above, verse 3, n).

228. pueros producit avaros] ‘Producere' 1³ here to educate. The
change oi tense from ‘praecepit’ should be observed, as denoting a
course ol training on aprinciple once laid down. The next lineis
omitted in some MSS„ but not in the best. It has no grammatical
connection with the sentence ; either therefore another line hasbeen
lost or this is the work oi an interpolator who forgot to finish the mis-
chiei he had begun. The language in 230, sqq., is taken, as is manifest,
from the chariat races.

231. quamsi revoces] The antecedent to ‘quem' is easily supplied
by substituting ‘ juveni' ior ‘curriculo' The chariot represents the
son, who is the real subject of the sentence. So immediately below
(verse 241) lor an antecedent to ‘quorum’ ‘Thebanos’ must be sub-
stituted ior ‘Thebas' which is the same thing, as ‘civitas' is equiva-
lent sometimes to ‘cives’ πόλις to πολῖται, and so iorth. The change
of person in ‘revoces' only makes the sentence more pointed. ‘Nes-
cit is used as Horace and others use ‘nescius’ ‘Revoces' is in the
subjunctive ol' a general nunditiam A. ta, 5, ο. ‘Permittas' is the
subjunctive hy attracti0n; Α. 66, 2. Neither construction is unusual.

234. adeo indulgent sibi latisssima] ‘Adeo' belongs to ‘indulgent;'
, “ so determined are they to take a wider indulgence without ashing
your leave '’ (ipsi). With ‘stultum' in the next verse we must supply

esseeum.'

23¹7. et circumscribere] See x. 222. Before ‘pneuma' ‘tantus' must
be supplied. See note on x. 13. As to the Decii, seeviii.254‚ n.
Menoeceus the son ol Creon was said to have sacrificed himself when
Thebes was besieged hythe seven chiefs. Teiresias the seer pro-

hesied that ii he did so the Thebans would gain the victory. duvenal
Elias a stroke at ,Greek history (see x. 174) : he therefore goes out oi

his way. and having spoken oi Thebes he adds the legend oi Cadmus
