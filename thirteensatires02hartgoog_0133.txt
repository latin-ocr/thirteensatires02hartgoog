verse 61. The ‘Via Latina' was the oldest rcad out of Rome, and ran
through the heart of Latium to Beneventum, where the ‘ Via Appia’
joined it. The chief reads leading out of Rome were lined for several
miles with the tombs of the wealthier citizens, burial within the walls
of the city being forbidden hythe twelve tables. Burning was prac-
tised, therefore, as earl as the Decemvirate. It grew afterwards
into general use, and s not discontinued till the end of the second
century of the Christian era. Heinrich supposes Juvenal, by mention-
ing the Flaminian and Latin ronds, to hint at Domitian and his favor-

Flaminia, and the other on the Via Latina

SATIRE 111.

ans is one of the best known of Juvenal's Satires. English
readers are familiar with Johnson’s imitation of it. We do not know
