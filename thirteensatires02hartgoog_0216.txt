sarran ιιι. 197

77. jam luxuriosa] Now it ha(grown to be luxurians. It was plain
enough, but a still simplet diet had gone before in the-good old days
of M. Curius Dentatus, whom the Samnites found preparing his own
supper of vegetables. The matrix ol a pregnant sou, or one that
had lately cast its litter, was counted a great delicacy.

82. Sicci tenua saia] He says the chine of bacon dried on ahurdle
in the ceiling was formerly kept to be produced on holidays or birth·
days. ‘Rara crate’ is a irame with wide interstices. All but the
legs and entrails of a sacrificed victim were caten. The birthday lard
was for moistening the vegetables perhaps. ‘ Moris' is the possessive
genitive: “it belonged to the custom oi former times.’'

86. Οογιιοιονιιιιι αἰιόιιιέ] On his birthday comes one oi his relations,
who has been thrice consul, not only with the title which in ‹Juvenal's
time was sometimes borne without the office, but 'with the command ’
of armies in the field, and moreorer he hasbeen dictator. The great
man comes early to dinner, shouldering the spade with which he has
been digging. Verse 89 is a picture. ‘Solito maturius’ means that
he leahihes his work earlier than usual to honor his relation’s birthday
orho' ay. ¹

90. Quum tremerent uatem] In the good days when men were afraid
oi the censors. ‘Autem' serves to continue the discourse. M. 437,
b. Of the Fabii there were many ceusors. M. Porcius Cato is the
elder ol that name, who was censor sc. 184, Μ. Aemilius Scaurus
was censor nc. 109, and C. Fabricius Luscinus ac. 275* Claudius
Nero and Livius Salinator were colleagues in the censorship rac. 2043
the reference in verse 92 is to them. They were both ‘equites' and
esch had a public horse. Livius had been condemned by the people
in his first consulship fifteen years before. During his censorship‚
when the names of his century were called over, the crier hesitated
whether he should call that oi Salinator, but Claudius obliged him to
do sc, and ordered his colleague to sell his horse as one who had been “
condemned ογ the people.

95. Olor-am Troiugenis} See i.100: “Ipsos Trojugenas.” The legs
oi the beds and muner-couches, as wellas the sides, were sometimes
highly ornamented. In the old times, he says, men were content

· with a small coueh with plain sides and abronze ornament in front

representing a rude ass's head crowned with vine-leaves. The ass
was sacred to Bacchus. The home-bred slaves (vernae), whom he
means by ‘ruris alumni,' made game ol the rude figure. The con·
struction in werse 96 is '‘sed (in) lectis nudo latere et parvis frons
aerea ostendebat,’ ‘on couches with bare sides and small, a iront of
bronze displayed the rude head of an ass with a wreath.’

100. Tunc radis et Graius] The allusion here is chiefly to the de·
struction oi Corinth by Mummius (aa. 146). The historians describe
the waste and destruction ol valuable works ol art as most deplorable.

103. Ut phaleris ponderet equus] The bridles and harneas ol horses
were commonly much ornamented with metal. ‘Phalerae’ include all
the harness and tra-ppings. Α fitting device lor a helmet would be the
