sarran v. 147

to lay waste his native place, is told by Homer (ΙΙ. ir). Virro's boat·
was a worthy companion for this monster. A boar served up whole
was commonly the chief dish t‘caput vcoenae ’). The tattening of
fowls (altiles) and the livers of geese was carried to pert'ection by
these Romans. The geese were tattened on flgs. ln our day Stras·
bourghas been famous forits priter de scies protasome ot the livere
weighing as much as three pounds. ‘Altiles’ were fattened on grain,
which was sometimes steeped in wine.

116. tradentur traham] ‘Tubera' were great delicaeies with the Ro·
mans. Whether they were what we know as the ‘tuber cibarium’ or
common truffle‚ has been doubted. They cannot have been very dit-
ferent. They were said to he produced by autumn raino and frequent
thunder; so the author calls the latter ‘optata' From this notion the
‘tuber' was called ‘ceraunium' The epicure Allidius is willing that
Libya, the greatest granary of Rome, should gire up sending corn
andfurnish only truffles. He is introduced in a parenthesis. On the
subjunctive ‘mittas' consult A. 61, 33 H. 503,1.; M. 351, b, obs. 2.

120.St1wctorem] This is the title ot theman whose business it
was to arrange (struere) the table. It is also used sor the person who
carved the meat, otherwise called ‘scissor' or ‘carpt0r.' The latter is
here meant. It appears that great men in this department carved
with various fantastic movements ot the arms and legs, flourishing
their knife about, as here described. These persons were trained
under regular professors. ‘chironomunta ’ is the Greek participle of
χειρουομέω, to throw the arms in time. ‘Dictata' are the lessons, and
‘dictare’ is to teach3 because it was usual sor the master to read
aloud to his scholars that which they had to learn and repeat.

who stole Hercules’s news, and was beaten to death by him with
stonesdand trunks of trees, and dragged out of his cave by the heels
when ead.

12⁷. Hiscere, tanquam hohas] ‘If you ever attempt to open your
mouth, as it you were a man of family and had three names' Ro
man citizens had generally three names: ‘praenomen' which was
giren on the ninth day after their hirth; ‘gentilicium nomen,' which
indicated the Gens to which they belonged; and ‘cognomen’ which
was the family name belonging to their branch ot' the Gens. To these
was sometimes added an honorary name, called ‘agnomen' derived
from some great action, or other cause, as ‘Publius Cornelius Scipio

Africanus! A slave had only one name, and a freedman took usually '

the ‘praenomen' and ‘nornen gentilicium’ of his late master, but not
his ‘ cognomen‚' instead of which he sometimes retained his own name
which he had as a slave. On ‘ habeas,' see A. 61‚and R. ,¹ M. 349 and
