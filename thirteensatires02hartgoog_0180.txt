geta abit before it reaches the master. Acoenonetus seems to be a
proper name invented for this gentleman, who takes as much and gives
. aslittlesshecan. The Greek ἀκοινώνητος is exactly copied.

221. Institor hiberae tepetis] He advises Palaemon to let theman take
a slice off his fee, and beat him down from his price, rather than lose
the whole of what he has sat up night after night to eam. ‘ Cadurcum’

Cadurci, a peoplc of Galba, who wove lineo cloth.

224. obliquo [onom deducere] ‘Obliquo ferro ' is the carding instru-
ment, consisting oi crooked bits of iron fastened in a board. ‘Dedu-
cere' and ⁴ trahere' are usual words for this process.

225. olfecisse lucernas] Boys going to school at night carried lanterna
with them; the master had to bear the smell of as many lampa as
there were boys, and their books were black with the smoke. The
works of Horace came to be a class-book, as he foretcld they would; “
Virgil's were thus used before his death. ·

228. quoe carnitione tribuni] What authority ior the administration

'second wife named Casperia, and her step-son is said to have com·
mitted incest with her. Acestes is the Sicilian king who twice re·
