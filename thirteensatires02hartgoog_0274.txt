property. Ii the ‘tutor' wes condemned, the penalty was ‘infamia'

Boys wore long hair like girls (‘ incerta') till they took the ‘toga
virilis! This is therefore the case oi a ‘pupillus' complaining of his
‘tutor’ during his pupilage. The ‘tutor' in such cases was some·
times removed. ·

140. Et minor igne rogi] Thetis, ‘too little ιο be burnt.' See refer-
ence ou iii. 203. It was not usual to burn children who died before
they had cut their teeth.

foce eliphas Arcana] There were no mysteries at Rome analogous
to those oi Greece, at which none but the initieted could be present,
who were bound by oath ιο keep secret the mysteries (whatever they
were) then made known ιο them. As every Greek might be initiated
il he leased, the secreoy did not amount to much. Neverthelessit

Ceres represented the Greek Demeter, and the allusion here is ιο
the Eleusinion mysteries, an Attic festival which lasted seven days.
On the flhh the initiated carried torches ιο the temple of the goddess,
led by epriest called from his office δᾳδοῦχοι. This explains ‘lace

senses oi ‘ ducere! See note on xii. 8. ’

149. Tantum aniame, nobis animum] ‘Anima' and ‘animus' ars
essentielly the same word, and are used as synonymous by the best
writers. But ‘anima' more commonly represents the principle oi
life, and ‘animus' the rational mind. That distinction is obvious
here. This sense oi ‘indulgere' ‘to give,' is not, 1 believe, fo md οι

155. Ul collata daretfidacr'a,] “ That united conlidence might bring
us slecp, secured by a neighbor's threshold.’' Juvenal says the effect
of that gift of mind was ιο lead men, through the allections they
have in common, ιο help one another, to form communities, ιο quit
the woods and live in towns, to light side by side, and to defend them
solves behind the same walls.
