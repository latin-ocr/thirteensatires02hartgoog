sannen xv. 237

au Sensit Memmii The story oi Alexander's interview with
Diogenes and how the ynic asked him not to stand between him
and the sun, is known to every schoolboy. ·The verbs in verse 314
are in the subjunctive by attraction. The verb of which ‘iric' is the
subject must be supplied in the subjunctive oi an indirect question.

31⁵. Nullum antiton atat] These words are repeated from x. 365. ·
‘In quantum’ means no more than ‘quantum’ it is ‘to whatever
lengths! As to Epicurus, see xiii. 123, n. He died about 130 years
after Socrates. The modesty oi* Socrates's wants is well known from

- tlte Memorabilia of Xenophon and i'rom the Clouds ot' Aristophanes,

who made ita matter oi ridicule.

321. Sapientia] Nature, which the Stoice professed to follow as their
guide, never differs from Sapientia or philosophy. See xiii. 20.

822. nt'deor te claudere s] He says “perhaps I seem to confine you
by too rigid examples; well, then, mix a little oi modern liie with
theirs ; go as iar as the amount Otho fixed forthe census of an eques ;
orii this is not enough, ii this makes you frown and pout your lip,
take the worth of two equites or even threet make up a third
400000 ;” ‘millia' is to be supplied. All this is explained on iii. ltt.

327. Stanacum implevi preminet!¹ ‘ Gremium ' is so used in vii. 215;
it is the fold of the togain'whic the purte was commonly carried.
Narcissus was the chief favorite of Claudius Caesar. He made a
fortune oi more than 100,000,000 sesterces (about 04000000). It was
he and not Claudius who ordered 'the death of Messalina (see x. 330,
n). Claudius was little more than a cipher in his own court.

SATIRE XV.

'Pars satire must have been written after Juvenal's residente in Egypt.
Under what circumstances he went to that country there is not suffi-
cient authority for saying with any certainty. In verse 27 there is an
allusion which gives fair ground for supposing that the poem was
written in the reign oi Hadrian about aa. 120 (see note). lt turns
upon a case said to have happened not long before. This story gives
occasion ior a good deal of strong contemptuous writing against the
Egyptians, with a vivid description oi a very savage scene, set off by
some fine lines on the more tendet instincta oi human nature, and the
ties of sympatliy that unite mankind. It seems aa if the story, whether
true or not, had been repeated to Juvenal and had called up all the
prejudices whicha residence among these people had created in his
mind. His power in sketching scenes from real life has been often seen

in the course oi these satiras. The person tnwhom the satire is ad·
dressed is unknown.
