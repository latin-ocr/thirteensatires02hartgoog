Juvenal says if he had never said a better thing than that he might
have suapped bis flngers at Antonius, quoting his own words (Phil. ii.
ibt: “Contempsi Catilinae gladios, uon pertimescam tuos'' On the
uso of ‘potuit' consult A. 59, 3, e; H. 512, 2, l; B. 1274. The pre-
ceding verse might be taken as the subject oi this verb, by a not
uncommon figure, a mau’s way of speaking being put t'or the man
himself. He adds, he would rather have been the authores his ridic-
ulous poetry than of that Philippie which he calls divine, famous, and
so forth. This speech was written in September, rac. 44, as a rejoin-
der to Antonius’s reply to the first Philippic. Cicero did not attend
the meeting ol the Senate at which Antonius s ke, and though this
speech professes to be an extemporaneous rep y, it was never deliv-
' ered, but written in the country, nor did Cicero venture to publish it
immediately. ‘Volveris' means ‘you are read;’ ‘aprima proxima'
is a way of ex ressing the second.

126. illata Exitus eripuit] After the death ot' Alexander, Demos·
the'nes used all his eloquenca to produce a general rising oi the Greek
states against Antipater, the successor to the Macedonian division of
Alexander’s kingdom, and succeeded. But the resistance of the
Greeks was not effectuah and, rather than fall into the hands oi An·
tipater, Demosthenes poisoned himself, sc. 322.

120. rnoderoatemfraena theatri. The popular assemblies (lisinnias)
were held in the Pnyx, a space o ground near the Areiopagus‚ till the
building oi the theatra of Dionysus in the ledaea, about rac. 340, aiter
which the assemblies were commonly held in the theatra. It was
finished in Demosthenes’s time, and he must often have spoken there.

129. Dis illa odacrsia] This is a common way ol speaking. Demos-

thenes's father was a man of property, and died when his son was .

seven years old. What Juvenal says here therefore is a mere floar-
ish. He was the owner oia sword or kniie nianul'actory, which
Juvenal has made the most of.

1³³. truncis affixa tropaeis] His next case is the vanity of military
glory. The practice of erecting trophiea alter victorias was very
ancient in Graece, and adopted by the Romans late in the republican
times. They were composed of arms taken trom the enemy and piled
up usually on the trunk of a trae or some low wooden frume. ‘Buc-
culae' are the cheeks of a helmet which were buttoned under the chin.
‘Buckle ' is derived lrom this word. ‘Cossis’ is properly a helmet ot
metifd, ‘ galea' oi leather. Some ‘galeae' lad visors which covered
the ace.

1³5. Etruriam temone jupam] A war chariot shom of its pole.
‘Curtum’ is not used elsewhere with anoun after it, but it is properly
a participle. ‘Aplustre ' is the curved ornament which most ancient

ships carried on their stern, commonly oi a fan shape, and not unlike i

the feathers oi a Red Indian chief. Sometimes it was wreathed with
flowers, sometimes it carried a flag or a lentem. ‘Humanis majora’
