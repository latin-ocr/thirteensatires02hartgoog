8³. laetam fecit qurrm Statius Urbem] The poet P. Papinius Statius
was the son of a school-master at Neapolis. lle was patronized by
Domitian, whom he flattered in the usual way. His poem called
Thebais, relating entirely to the expedition against Thebes, which
Aeschylus has rnade the subiect oi a tragedy, occupied him twelvc
years, a year for each boola. lt was linished some time between an.
87 and 90, and therefore was begun before Domitian became emperor,
an. 81. During the time it was composing he recited parts oi it, and
at that time he seems to have been poor. Whether he afterwards

rollted by the patronage of the emperor or not is unknown. By
Surenal’s description his poem seems to have been highly thought of,
and his manner of reciting it was attractire.

86. fregit subsellio] Probably by his energy in reciting his poem.
Some say, by the loudappl'ause of his hearers; others, by overcrowd-
‚in the seats.

g87. intactam Poridi nisi vendat Aptuca] ‘Unless he sells his virgin
Agave to Paris! ‘intactam' has the same sense as ‘integram’
Whether this means that other poets had not handled the subject, or

' that the play had not yet been in the aetors' hands, and was unpub

lished‚ may be doubtful. Agave is the furious mother who tore her
son Pentheus to pieces at the revels of Dionysus, as represented in
Euripides's play, the Bacchae. Paris may have bought the play out
of charity to the writer. He was an Egyptian pantomima, and very
popular upder Dpnpitian. For ‘vendat’ consult M. 350, b, obs. 2; Η.

88. Ille et militiae] He goes on to say. that Paris used his mfluenee
with Domitian to get advancement for the poeta. It appears to me
to be kindly said and kindly meant towards Paris, whose conduct is
contrasted with that of the ‘proceres’ Tho military offices Juvenal
says he got conferred upon poets were those of ‘praefecti' and ‘tri-
buni militares! There was a distinction of tribunes, some being
called Laticlavii and others Angusticlavii; those being oi the sena·
torial order, these of the equestrian. Both classes were much sought,
and in order to gratlfy more applicants the office was made half·
yearly (semestri). 'l'he golden ring was a badge of the ‘equites’
This passage is associated with the principal event recorded of Juve-
npl’pllife,land the reader is referred to the memoir at the beginning

90. ta Camerinos Et Bareas] Camerinus was the name oi abranch
oi the patrician gens Sulpicia. n was much distinguished in tlte
pimelpg the republic. One oi the Bareas has been mentioned before
ιιι. ,

92 Desertor Pelopea facit‚] He says plays make praefecta and tri·
burres, as explained above. ⁴ Pelopea’ may be any subject connected
with the house of Pelops. ‘Pulpitum' corresponded to that part of
the stage which the Greeks called λογεῖον, where the actors spoke.

94. aut Proculeius Aut Fabitur] The first of these was the erson
whose liberalit to his brethren or relations is mentioned by oraoe
(C. ii. 2. t). e was connected by marriage and contemporary with
