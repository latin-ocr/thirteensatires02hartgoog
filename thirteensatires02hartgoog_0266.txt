to be the famous statue oi Memnon, from which it was believed that
sounds proceeded at the rising of the sun produced by tbe impression
of his ruys. Strabo mentions them, but says that part of ons had
fallen owing toan eartbquake, and that from the part that remained
in its place a sonnd such as might proceed t'rorn a blow was heard once
.· a day. He himself heard it, and where it came from he professes to
be ignorant, but he is not inclined to believe it issned irorn the stone.
Pausanias, who visited the stat-ue, found it broken aa Strabo described
it, and says it was supposed to have been broken by Cambyses. He
compares the sound to the snapping of a barp-string. Strabo wrote
during vthe lite ot our Saviour, Pausanias at least a hundred and fitly
years aiter Strabo. Juvenal may have seen the statue about half a
century before Pausanias. ln his time, however, the statue which has
since been restored was mutilated, which is the meaning of ‘dimidia'
as below, verse ts, “vultus Dimidios,'' aad viii. 4, “ Curios jam
dimidios.” ‘Magicae chordae' implies that Pausanias described the
sound according to popular notione. Itis generally supposed to have
been a trick of the priests executed by some simple mechanieal con·
trivance. The statue supposed to be that of Memnon shows evident
marks of having been restored, the body from the waiet upwards being
ot several pisces and of a different stone from the legs and pedestal,
which are a monolith. When this restoration took place is unknown.
· It is attributed by Heeren to Septimius Severus, who restored some
of the Egyptian monuments. His reign was from ao. 193 to 211. The
height is about fifty feet, and that oi the pedestal six feet. Memnon, ’
the son ol Eos and Tithonus, was a Greek adaptation from the narne
of several Egyptian kings, Phatnenoth or Amenophth. The priests'
jugglery may have arisen out of the fabulous birth ,the Greeks at·
tributed to Memnon as son of the morning.

,6. Atque vetus Thebe] The notion that ancient Thebes had a hundred
gates was derived from Homer, and was received like other poetical
fables by the Greeks and Romans without much inquiry. Thebes was
perhaps the most ancient town of Egypt, and was originally tbe me-
tropolis and residence os the kings whose tombs are among the aston-
ishing ruins that remain to this day. The ,Persians under Cambyses
about ac. 520 pillaged aad partly destroyed the temples and burnt the
private dwellings. Its downfall was completed about no. 85, when,
the inhabitants having revolted from Ptolemy Lathyrus. it was taken
after a three years’ siege aad pillaged. Strabo describes it as in his
day a city of ruins covering a space of eighty stadia (ten miles) in
circuit, while the inhabitants occupied, as they do still, a iew villages

on each side of the river. The effect of the ruins is usually described '

as overpowering. One sentence of Belzoni’s expresses this effect:
“It appeared to me like catering a city of giants, who after a long
conflict were all destroyed, leaving the ruins of their various temples.
as the only root ot their former existencess’'

7. Itttc trebiros] ‘Aelurus' is the Greek word for a cat (aitarens).
This animal was chiefly worshipped in the city of Bubastis on the
Pelusiae branch of the Nile. It was sacred to the goddess Pasht, cor·
