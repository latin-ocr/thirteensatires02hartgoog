75. Tandem intrat 000100οΓ The port 01 Rome was for some centuries
Ostia, which was originally built at the mouth 01 000 Τ1000, 000
gradually became less accessible from the sea through the deposit 01
0011 brought down by the river. In consequence 01 this the Emperor
Claudius 10000 year 00. 42 caused a basin to be dug two miles to
the north, which was connected with the river by means of a canal.
Here ships oi large size were able to ride, the basin beingprotected
by two moles which 000 000 1000 000 000, 000 between them there was
a breakwater with alighthouse upon it. This basin was called Portus
Augusti. Trajan increased and improved this artificial 000000 (which

The above account explains the text. ‘Porrectaque brachia rursum'
means that the moles were curved outwards beyond the break-
water and took a bend inwards behind it. ‘Non sic igitur' is ‘not
so much then‚’ such being the character 01 the work. ‘Sed' means
0000 though the outer basin was saie, 000 pilot thought it better with
his disabled ship to go into the other. Gibbon (c. xxxi.) gives an
account oi this port, which he calls “ one ο1 000 boldest and most

water Tyrrhenam Pharon 01000 000 Alexandrian Pharos, on which ·
