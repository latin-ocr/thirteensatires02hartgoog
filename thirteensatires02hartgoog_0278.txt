suman xvr. Ι 251 ’

posfflmyit uon reddere nummos, “ Persists in not restoring money de·

with him.'' This is the offence that gave occasion for S. xiii.
The next line is repeated from the 137th oi that satire.

42. qui lites inchoet aurens] “ 1 must wait ior some indefinite tima that
shall even make a beginning of the canses of an entire people.'' So
Heinrich takes it, and 1 see no better way. ‘Annus totius populi' 1
can make no meaning of. ‘Annus' is probably a definite word ior an
indefinite period. ‘inchoare’ is commonly used ior such a beginning
as is not brought to an end; and ‘tunc quoque,' etc, means that no
more than a beginning is made or likely to be made.

44. toties subsellia tantum] This means that the court was ready,
cushions on the scats, and everybody there, but tha advocates loitcred.
The case must therefore wait. ·

46. parati Digredimur] This is the language oi the amphitheatra.
“ Prepared to light, we are obliged to separate, and the iorum is but a
slow arena sor our combat.'' ‘Balteus' was a belt which went over
the shoulder and held the sword. ‘Sufflamine'is used in vm 148
for a drag. audit is here used in that sense figuratively.

51 tmtandi militibus jus] Under the Roman law all that a son ac·
t{itti‘’hittitfitetlitli{stetististristitiis ⁰:
will. About the time oi Augustus au exception was made in favorgof
money acquired through military service, which was called ‘castrense
peculinm‚' Whatever a son had while ha was ‘in patria potestate'
was ‘peculium’ and with certain modificatione was held on the same
terme as a slave's (iii. 189, n). ln the time oi Constantine the
same privilege that attached to the ‘castrense peculinm‚' or money
' earned in military service, was extended to money earned in civil

’ offices, which was therefore called ‘quasi castrense peculium! This,

as Heinrich says, is an argument in favor of the satira having been
written before the time oi Constantine, ko. 806. ‘Non esse in corpore
census' means that it was not part oi the property which was under
his father’a control. ‘Placuit' means only that it is settled law. The
legal word for ‘regimen' is ‘potestas' ,

54. Ergo Coranum signorum comitem] Horace l S. ii. ὅ) refers to the
story of one Nasica, a fortunabunter, who was laughed at by one
Cbranus. Tho name Coranus seems to have become proverbial in
this connection. This man, because he has got money oi his own¹
which he has the power to dispose oi, is courted by his own father,
trembling with years, in hopes he may survive his rich son yet, and
get something by his will. ‘Captare' is tha common word in this
sense.

saliuncam amaus] There is no sense in this. Some think
‘labor' should be ‘favor' Thi· is the only conjecture that has thrown
light on the passage. ‘Pulcro labori' is the sameas ‘labore militiac'
above (verse 52). ‘Hunc’ refers to the former of the two persons, a
not unccmmon usage.

58. ducis hoc referre videtur] This use of the genitive with ‘referre’
is easily understood by resolving ‘referre’ into its parts, ‘rem ferre ς’
