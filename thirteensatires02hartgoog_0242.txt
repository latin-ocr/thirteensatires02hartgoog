pecten, a reference to the simplicity of the olden time, and there are
one or two picturas, as oi the anxious host (59, sqq.) and the soldier's
family (166, sqq.), such as Juvenal sketches with peculiar power. The
satire belongs ιο about the same date as the preceding one.

Aauuwpxr. -Tbere is many a disgraceful habit which parents
teach their children. What can you hope of the boy whose father is
aglutton or cruel to his householdl what of the girl who cannot
count her mother’s paramours (1-30lt Home examples corrupt most
speedily oi all. Keep then from wrong for this reason, iiior no other;
forali are easily taught vice (31-43). Great reverence is due to boys.
Whatever wrong γοιι do, your son will grow up like you; and then
you will want to punish him lor the very thing that you have done
(tt-58). Yon cleause your house when you expect guests3 do γοα
not care that your son may see a spotless homel The fledged bird is '
sure to seek the kind of lood which its mother brought to the nest.
Yon waste money in building, he will do the same; you follow deiv-
ish customs, he will go to greater lengths in them (ea-106). The
young are forced against their will to imitate avarice. They are de-
ceived by its garb οιΙ gravity and by the praise it geta. See how the
father traina his aon in every sort ol stinginess! What madness! As
money grows, the love of it grows too. So meu resort ιο any means
to get more houses and wider fields. Who cares what the world says?
We cannot be satisfled with the way in which rustics lived years ago
(lor-188). Now you set your son ιο studying or to secking the
' honora of war-in fact, to getting money in any way. But you need
not be so anxious. The pupil will outstrip the teacher. His rich wile
will not live long. Nay, you y-ourself, who have taught him'to lie and
cheat, will not escape; γοα had best buy antidotes soon l raa-255). It
isas good as a play ιο see how men work for money. They sail over
the sea, running greater riske than the repe-dancer runa; they do not
care for storms; they have to swim for life, and then perhaps to beg
(tot-302). Diogenes was not afraid oi a fire; Alexander learned
from him the foolishness of avarica and discontent. Get along with
as little as you can; Nature and Philosophy both bid you do this.
But you will not be satisfieri, unless you have samuch as Croesus or
’ the Persian kings or our Emperor's favorite freedman (soa-331).

1. Plurima aaut] There are many habits which deserve ιο be evil
spoken oi, and which fasten upon fair things a atain that will never
leave them. The fair things are the unspoilt minda of children.
These habits corrupt their minds, and get them bad repnte. ‘F igere'
and ‘haerere' both express the lasting mischiei these practices do.
‘Monstrant traduntque ' is they ‚not only show these practices in their
own conduct, but teaoh thern to their children. ‘Tradere ' is a common
word ior teaching. As to ‘alea,’ see xi. 176, n., and i. 88, 11. The
kind of gaming here alluded to is explained in the next verse, where
‘arma' means the ‘tali’ or ‘tesserae' and ‘fritillus' was the box
from which they were thrown. Other names lor the box were
‘pyrgus' (πύργος) or ‘turricula’ and ‘phimns’ (φιμός). ‘Heres' is
equivalent to ‘fliius' here and in xii. 95, since a man's children were
