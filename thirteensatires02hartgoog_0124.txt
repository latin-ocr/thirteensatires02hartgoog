47. ethic damnatas inani ‚ludiciol We have ihc private thies and the

‘ repetundae,' which was that oi a magistrate getting money by illegal
means from the provinciale under his govemment, was punished with
different penalties at different times. 'Phe latest ‘ lex’ on the subject
was the ‘lex Julia,’ passed in the dictatorship oi Cathillus Caesar,
which abolished the punishment of exile3 but it appears to have been
revived under the empire. The refunding of the money proved to
have been received was always part oi the penalty; and in this in·
stance it appears that 700 sestertia (about onnon) were paid by
Marius into the treasury. ‘Ab octava hibit' mearts that he sat down
to dinner earlier than usual ; the ninth hour in summer, and the tenth
in winter, being those at which industrious persons generally dinen.
‘Fruitur dis iratis,’ he enjoys the angeroi the gods ; that is, he males
himself comiortable under his punishment. For the idiom, see A. 72,
3,a; H.580; B. 13575 A. da S. 274, R. 5. ‘Vincere' is the legal
word ior succeeding in a cause.

51. Venusino diyna lucana t] Horace was bom at Venusia, on the
Appian Way, between Beneventum and Tarentum, nc. 65. He
seems to havc been loched upon by Persius and Juvenal as the repre·
sentative of Roman satire. Lucilius was more in J uvenal's way, and
he mentions him below with respect. ‘Lucema' only meane what
we mean when we speak of the ‘midnight oil.'

52 Sed quid maqr's [incolens] ‘Agitem' must be repeated, but in a
different sense. ‘Fabulas’ is the noun to be supphed, if any is
needed. He aske why he should rather rite on such hackneyed
subjecte as the labors of Hercules, the warffeffngs oi Diomed, the ad· Δ
ventures of Theseus, Icarus, and Daedalus, than attack the vices os c
the dayl ‘Puero' may be the ablativa of ‘¹ dead weight,” as Mayor
calla it, or the dative. See reierences on verse 13. ‘Mugitum’ refers
of course to the Minotaur.

55. Quam lwecipiot moechi bonel This man connives at his wife's =
intrigues at his own table, and gete her PstQUl to make him his
‘heres' which the woman could not be, ii the man's census exceeded
100,000 asses. He fines his eyes on the ceiling, as is wrapped in
thought, or pretends to snore over his wine. ,

58. Quum sas esse putet] “When that man thinks he has origin to
look for a tribune’s place, who, while yet a hoy‚ wasted his substance
on his Q and lost his patrimony with dying on swiit coach down · ,οι
the Flamrman rond ; ior henas Automedon and held the rems while ¹
the great man made himself pleasant to his man-mistress.'’ This per·
son may have been some favorite of Domitian’s, who had been made,
or hoped to be made, a ‘tribunus militum' The Flaminino road led
north irom Rome to Ariminum. ‘Ipse' is often used independently
