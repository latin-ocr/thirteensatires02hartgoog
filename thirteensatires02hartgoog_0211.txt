peror's absenceinOstia to marr him publicly, sm. 48. Tacitus says
Silius (whom Messalina induce to lput away his wite) was not igno-
rant ol the greatncss oi the sin oro the danger, but being certam of

death tt he rejected her, and having some hope ol escaping discovery,
at the same time attracted by the great prizes within his reach, he
consoled himself with waiting ior the future and enjoying the present
moment. The intrigue was carried on without any concealment on
the part oi Messalina; bnt according to Tacitus it was Silius who
proposed to her that they should marry, and she with some reluctance,

earing lest she should losa her hold n'pon him, consented. lt suits
Juvenal's purpose to give a dill'crent version ol the story, or he may
have heard and believed what he says, that the man had no choice
but compliance or death. The whole matter- is well discussed by Meri-
vale, v. 425-436, who should b all means be consulted ltere.

3³2 rapitur miser exstingues us] He is hurried to his death by Mes·

y salina's eyes, ‘oculis' depends on both. With ‘decies centena' we

must supply ‘sestertia’ or ‘millia sestertium.' ‘Ritu untiquo’ refers
to the ‘dos,' not to the amount oi it. The ‘ signatores' were witnesses
to the marriage contraot. The ‘auspices' were probably in attend·
auce at marriages oi importance, or at the signing of the contract,
{aad went through some formula. They declared whether the day was
ortunate. .

339. antelucanas] Before dark. If he consented he would get a
short delay till a scandal known to all the town should reach the ears
of the emperor, who was at Ostia when this monstrous transaction
occurred. On the form oi the conditional sentence, see A. 59, 4,ὸ“
and R.; Η. 511, ιι, 1 ; B. 1271. The courtiers were in much perplex-
ity as to how they should act for their own saiety; and finally the
marriage was reported to Claudius through two of his concubines.
After a good deal ol hesitation Claudius ordered the death of Silius,
who died without tear. Messalina would have escaped if Narcissus
had not pretended the emperor's orders and caused her to he put to
death. When tho emperor was informed that she was dead he asked
no questions, bnt called ior his wine and went to dinner.

cession. It does not depend upon ‘quidquid' ¹

354. Ut tamen et poscas] “ You had better not ask any thing ; but
suppose you must ask something, let it be a healthy mind aod a
healthy body, a stout heart, patient and content.’' ‘Et' is used lor
emphasis, as the Greeks used καί. ‘sacellis' means the chapel every
man had in his house, in which were images oi the Lares, to whom

J “ the offertng ofapig was common. ‘Tomaculo' is minoed meat, de-
l

rivell from τέμνω. ‘Fortem' implies resolution in keeping the right
course, morel courage arud consistency3 a heart which while it counts
death ahoon is able to bear patiently the hard task of living. ‘Pluma’
means ieather beda or pillows.
