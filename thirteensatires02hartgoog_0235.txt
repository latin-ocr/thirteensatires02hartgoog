away such 1001 than 10 put away the cause 01 11 Juvenal knew what
he was writing about.

·10⁷. ruou od deintra 00000101] “ 11 you mistrust him, and bid him
come 10 the temple and ewear by the altar. he will go there before
you, uay, will be the 1110110 chahenge you to go there, and will abuse,

Ι sud perhaps strike, you 101 doubtiug 1110 honesty.’' The offended liar,

taking the character 01 injured innocence, is amusingly illustrated in
Falstaff. As to ‘superest' Gelhus informs us that a mlsuse 01 the

word came into iashion, as in the expression ‘hic illi superest,' ‘this is “ ¹

that man’s advocate' On some occasion 1110 praetor, in reply to an
advocate who said ‘ego illi supersum,’ wittily retorted, ‘tu plane
superes, non ades,' a jolce difficult to translate; but 110 meant 10 say
that the advocate was quite usele‘ss, 101 he was not doing an advocate's
duty (adesse). ‘l‘idueia'is confidence (in a good sense), confidence
in his own honesty.
¹ 110. Minium 0911 itta] ‘All the while be is only acting like the ruu-
away slave in some mimus 01 Catullus,’ who is referred to on viii.
186, with his plays Phasma and Laureolus. The name 01 1110 slave in
the play (here called ‘scurra ’), the Scholiast says, was Vorenus. He
wasa great 111101, and stole sorue money 110111 0 bauker, on which
there is ajoke 01 which the point does not appear. ‘ Urbani ' is ‘ witry!
na. ut Stentora uincere possis] Stentor was the Greek herald with
· the mighty voice in Homer3 his voice was 00 loud 00 the shout 01
fifty men. But Ares, when hiomed wounded him, according 10 1110
0001, shouted as loud as nine thousand or ten thousand men in battle.

113. Audis, luppiter, loce] ‘Labra movere' is opposed to ‘mittere
vocem ; ' the one isa suppressed cry hardly audible, the other loud.
‘Nec'is‘noteven’ , ,

115, Debueras] ‘lt had been thy duty to speak out hadst thou been
marhle 01 bronze.’ The use 01 this 101111 101 ‘debuisses' has been
noticed above on iii. 163. As to Vagellius, the name occurs below,
xvi. 23. The person is unknown. The writer must have had some
statue in his mind. The Scholiast says Vagellius was 0 great 1001,
but like the gods he got 0010100. ‘Omeutum’ is properly the niem-
brane 11101 covers the howels, and the word is 00 used still. Here it
means the entrails.

. 120. Accipe quae contra] He begs him to accept such consolation as
even he, who professes to be no philosopher, never to have read the
dogmas 01 Cynics or 810100, and to be no admirer 01 Epicurus, may
be able to 01101 him. The name 01 the Cynics was given them 111 the
time 01 their founder, Antisthenes, immediately 01101 the death 01
Socrates, his teacher. But the popular idea 01 their character is de-
rived more from Diogenes 01 8111000, the crabbed disciple 01 Antis-

* thenes. The 81010 school was founded full threequarters 01 0 century

01101 1110 Cynic by Zeno, who had in his earlier studies attached him·
0011 10 1110 Cynics, but modified his opinions, and gave tu the views 01
that school a 111010 general and expansive character. But the Stoice,
too, became more contracted under the successore 01 their founder,
and in the popular notions 01 Juvenal's timeas in our own, there was
not much differeuce between the twd systems. Juvenal 0101000οε 10
